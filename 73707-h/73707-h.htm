<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Jessie started out in the morning to
school, she began at the gate to say to herself,
“Bridge, Railroad, Hill,” and when she started
home again if she came alone, it was “Hill,
Railroad, Bridge.” Home was at one end of the
journey; school at the other; Bridge, Railroad
and Hill were the stations between, Jessie told
herself. If she were reasonably early, she would
stop on the bridge and peep over at the running
water. At the railroad she seldom stopped except
to say good-morning to Ezra Limpett who
sat outside his little box of a house on sunny
days, and inside it on rainy ones. He always
held out the red flag to show the engineer, when
the trains went whizzing by. Once, when the
train was behind time, he had allowed Jessie to
hold the fluttering flag, but that was on her way
home, and he had said she must never cross till
the train had passed. It was on account of Ezra<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
that Jessie was allowed to go to the Hill school,
for he never failed to be at his post watching for
her, and Jessie’s father knew she would be perfectly
safe in crossing the track because Ezra
was there. Of course, it was pleasanter to come
from school than to go to it, not only because
it was down hill and home was at the far end of
the way, but because Effie Hinsdale could come
nearly as far as the railroad with her, and a companion
always makes the distance seem shorter.
Furthermore, there was time then to loiter, unless
one felt very hungry, though loitering meant
a talk with Ezra about the engines and the trains.
The engines were always spoken of as <i>her</i> and
<i>she</i> and were known by their numbers.</p>

<p>One day when Jessie was about to skip across
the railroad ties, she heard Ezra call out: “Better
wait a bit. 589 ain’t came along yet. She’s
late to-day by ten minutes, and she’s due just
about now.”</p>

<p>“Will you let me hold the flag?” said Jessie,
turning aside.</p>

<p>Ezra nodded. “Hold her good and tight, and
don’t stand too near. She’ll go kitin’ to-day because
she’s behind time. Here, stand on this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
stone and I’ll hold on to ye. That’s her whistle
now, so up with ye.”</p>

<p>Jessie scrambled upon the stone and gripped
the flag tightly, while Ezra took a firm hold upon
her. The train was in sight in a second, and
almost before she could wink, it went flying by,
scattering the dust and causing Jessie’s skirts to
flutter in the breeze it made. It was very exciting,
though it was something of a relief to see
the tail end of the train disappear down the track.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t like to be in her way, would ye?”
said Ezra, helping the little girl down.</p>

<p>“Indeed, I wouldn’t,” replied Jessie decidedly.
“Do you like better to be inside your funny little
house, Ezra, or outside it?”</p>

<p>“That depends. Wet days I’m glad to be in;
sorter cozy with a fire and my pipe going.
’Tain’t very big, but it’s fair enough shelter, and
it ain’t as if I hadn’t a roomier place to actually
live in. I don’t have it so very bad, for there
ain’t no night trains and I can get home and
have my night’s rest. I’m always in by nine, for
there ain’t no trains after six. If this was a big
trunk line now, the trains would be chugging by
all night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>“Then don’t the conductors and engineers ever
sleep?”</p>

<p>“Some of ’em mighty little. There’s hard
tales about how they’re worked. Folks all
well?”</p>

<p>“Yes, thank you,” returned Jessie, picking up
her books which she had dropped on the ground,
and being reminded by Ezra’s remark that she
must not stay too long. “I reckon I’d better be
going now; mother might be worrying about
me.”</p>

<p>Ezra nodded. “That’s right. Days gettin’
kinder short, too. You won’t get home much
before sundown, come winter.”</p>

<p>“Won’t I?” Jessie had not thought of this.
“I’ll always have to hurry then.”</p>

<p>“And you won’t find me settin’ out in the cold
so over often,” said Ezra.</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” said Jessie.</p>

<p>Ezra nodded and waved a stubby hand as if to
a departing train, while Jessie ran across the
track and took up the last part of her accustomed
chant. Hill and Railroad were passed, so there
was only Bridge left. “Bridge, Bridge, Bridge,
Bridge,” she whispered, keeping time to her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
pace, and very soon Bridge, too, was left behind
and she was within sight of the lane, the house,
the barn, and, last, her mother’s anxious face at
the window.</p>

<p>“You’re late, dear,” said Mrs. Loomis, as the
little girl came into the sitting-room.</p>

<p>“Yes,” returned Jessie. “589 was behind time
and Ezra wouldn’t let me come till she had
passed. He let me hold the flag. I like the
train to be late for it is exciting to have her go
by so fast it almost takes your breath.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like it to be late,” replied Mrs. Loomis,
“for I always feel anxious about you till you get
home. If Ezra were not there, and if I didn’t
know we could absolutely depend upon him to
watch out for you, I don’t know what we should
do.”</p>

<p>“What do you think you would do?” asked
Jessie. “Would you or father have to come for
me? Would you have to do that?”</p>

<p>“No, we couldn’t do that very well. We
should have to send for you, probably, or else
keep you from school altogether.”</p>

<p>“I’d like that,” said Jessie in a satisfied tone.</p>

<p>“You’d like to grow up a silly little dunce?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
returned her mother, “and not know how to read
or write? Would you like Max and Walter to
come home from school and be ashamed of their
little sister?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” Jessie was quite sure she would not.
“But,” she said after a moment’s thought,
“everybody doesn’t have to go to school. Cousin
Lillian does not. I could have a governess.”</p>

<p>“That is what you would have to have, though
it would be rather expensive. The boys have to
go away to school and it costs a good deal for
them. But we’ll not bother over the question
while Ezra is on hand, for now it is perfectly safe
for you to go to the Hill school.”</p>

<p>“Suppose something should happen to Ezra,”
said Jessie, persistently following up the subject.
“I should hate anything to happen to him, but if
it should, and another man were to take his
place, then would I have to stop going to school?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know, child. We won’t discuss
it now. It will be time enough when such a
thing happens.” And Mrs. Loomis went out,
leaving Jessie standing by the window.</p>

<p>Jessie stood for a few minutes looking out and
then she, too, left the room. It was time to feed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
the chickens and after that her father would be
coming in. The corn had been harvested and
stood stacked in the fields. Jessie thought the
stacks looked very much like Indian wigwams
and she pictured to herself her terror if they
really were such. However, the terror was not
very keen and was soon forgotten when she
reached the spot where the fowls were jostling
one another and pecking eagerly at the corn Minerva
was scattering on the ground. Minerva
was the servant who had lived in the family ever
since she was a little girl. She was very fond of
Jessie and the two often had long talks about the
chickens, the pigeons, the ducks and the turkeys.</p>

<p>“There’s two young turkeys missing,” said
Minerva as Jessie appeared. “After I get
through here you can go ’long with me if you
like and look ’em up. You’re a right good hand
for spying ’em out and they do beat everything
for wandering.”</p>

<p>“I believe I know where they are,” Jessie told
her. “I shouldn’t wonder if they were over there
where the mountain cherries grow. I’ve seen
them there lots of times.”</p>

<p>“Then that’s where we’ll look for ’em,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
Minerva, scattering another handful of corn.
“They’re big enough now not to care much about
being with the old ones, and I have to keep an
eye on ’em.”</p>

<p>“Have you fed the young chickens yet?”
asked Jessie. “How fast they do eat, Minerva.
Look at that great piggy rooster driving away
that smaller one. I never did like that old yellow
fellow, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“He is kind of greedy,” agreed Minerva. “No,
I haven’t fed the young chickens. You can mix
the meal if you like. Don’t make it too wet like
you did last time. Mrs. Speckle is a little droopy;
she don’t take her food well at all. She’s such a
good layer, I hope there’s nothing wrong with
her.”</p>

<p>Jessie moved away to get the meal. Two
measures of it she carefully piled up in the
tin box which she found in the bin. This she
emptied into a pan and then she poured in a little
water at a time, stirring it with a spoon at first,
and then with her whole hand. She liked the
operation, and was so interested in squeezing
the wet meal that Minerva finally had to call
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>“If you’re going to help me hunt those
turkeys, you’d better hurry with that meal,” she
said.</p>

<p>Jessie carried the tin pan to the enclosure
where the young chickens were making a great
fuss, poking their heads between the slats and
peeping anxiously. But their peeping soon
stopped as Jessie scattered little dabs of the food
on the ground. “Don’t gather the eggs till I
come,” she called to Minerva whom she saw
searching the nests.</p>

<p>“Obliged to,” returned Minerva, “or there’ll
be no time to look up the turkeys. It gets dark
so much sooner these days, you know.”</p>

<p>With one swoop of the wooden spoon Jessie
swept the rest of the meal into a pile on the
ground, set down the pan and joined Minerva.
“How many are there to-day?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Ten, so far.”</p>

<p>Jessie climbed upon a box and peered into a
corner. “There are two more here,” she said.
“Shall I take them?”</p>

<p>“If you’re careful not to break them,” Minerva
told her.</p>

<p>Jessie gently lifted one egg at a time and put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
it in the basket Minerva carried. “That makes
a dozen,” she said.</p>

<p>“And here’s another in this nest,” Minerva
went on. “Old Posy is laying again, I expect.”</p>

<p>This was the last egg found, and the two left
the hen-house. Minerva carried the basket into
the house and then she and Jessie started off toward
a corner near the garden where the mountain
cherries grew, and where many other wild
things made a close thicket, so that it was hard
to penetrate the middle of the place. But Jessie
had been there many a time. It was one of her
favorite spots in summer. So now she pressed
her body through the tangle of blackberry vines,
pokeweed, sumach and laurel bushes to a less
crowded part of the thicket. There was a dogwood
tree here, and upon its lower branches sat
the two turkeys entirely satisfied with the roost
they had selected for the night.</p>

<p>“Here they are,” sang out Jessie.</p>

<p>Minerva followed the little girl. “Well, I declare!”
she exclaimed. “It takes you to find
’em. I believe you know every foot of this
place.” She grabbed first one turkey, then another.
They set up protesting cries which were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
of no use whatever, for Minerva held them firmly
and carried them home triumphantly under each
arm. “It’s too cold for you to be out,” she said,
addressing the turkeys. “I should think you’d
have better sense. I shouldn’t wonder if we
were to have frost to-night, and then where
would your toes be?”</p>

<p>“Why, they’d be under them all covered up
with feathers,” put in Jessie.</p>

<p>Minerva laughed. “You know more about it
than I do, it seems. Well, anyhow, they’d better
be in where it’s safe and warm. Young
turkeys are delicate. Besides, some crittur might
catch them.”</p>

<p>This was not to be denied as Jessie informed
the turkeys. “You’re much safer in the hen-house,
you two silly things,” she said, “so you
ought to be much obliged to us for getting you.
I’m sure I shouldn’t want to stay out in the cold
and dark all night and have wild beasts get after
me. Minerva, that yellow house just this side
the bridge must be taken, for there are people
living in it. I saw a cat sitting on the porch and
there was a little rocking-chair in the garden.
Do you suppose it belonged to a little girl?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>“It might. I should say it was very likely to.
Little boys don’t usually care for rocking-chairs.”</p>

<p>“I hope it is a nice little girl and that I shall
get acquainted with her,” returned Jessie. “Effie
Hinsdale is my nearest girl friend and neighbor
and she lives across the railroad track.
Mother says twice a day is as often as she likes
to think of my crossing the track, but when
Ezra is there I shouldn’t think she’d mind.”</p>

<p>“I should think she would mind,” said Minerva.
“Don’t you see enough of the girls at
school?”</p>

<p>“Ye-es,” said Jessie doubtfully, “I suppose I
do, but it’s only at recess, you know, for I always
hurry home. I was late to-day because
589 was behind time.”</p>

<p>“That’s the four o’clock, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but Ezra always calls her 589.”</p>

<p>“And that’s why you do. I suppose that’s a
fairly good reason. There’s your father and
Sam coming up the lane. I’ll put up the turkeys
and you can open the gate for them.”</p>

<p>Jessie ran down the long avenue of trees
which led up to the house, opened the gate and
stood there while her father drove in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>“Climb up, Puss,” he said, “and I’ll take you
around to the barn. Been a good girl to-day?
Missed any lessons?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know how to spell ‘conscientious,’”
Jessie told him, “and two examples weren’t quite
right.”</p>

<p>“That’s not so bad. A good many people
don’t know how to spell ‘conscientious,’” said
her father with a little laugh. “Any demerits?”</p>

<p>“One,” said Jessie a little shamefacedly and
quickly changing the subject. “I held the flag
for 589,” she said. “Ezra let me.”</p>

<p>“The train was late, I know,” said Mr. Loomis.
“I heard the whistle and hoped you were safe
across.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t. Ezra wouldn’t let me go, though
there was plenty of time. He said suppose I
should fall.”</p>

<p>Her father nodded. “He’s right. Nice old
chap, Ezra is. Well, here we are. Run in and
tell Minerva that Sam has a basket of peaches
in the wagon. They’re the last we’ll get this
year.”</p>

<p>“Where did you get them, father?”</p>

<p>“From that tree over in the south field; it’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
a late variety, but they will be pretty good for
preserves.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to have one before that happens,”
said Jessie, running into the kitchen and meeting
Sam just as he was bringing in the peaches.</p>

<p>“Work for you to-morrow, Minervy,” he said
as he set down the basket.</p>

<p>“That’s so,” returned Minerva. “Well, I
don’t mind. Them white peaches makes fine
preserves and we haven’t any too many peaches
put up this year. Hungry, Sam?”</p>

<p>“You bet,” he replied. “Always am. Seems
to me I don’t more’n get one meal down than
I’m ready for another.”</p>

<p>“It ain’t quite as bad as that,” returned
Minerva. “I’ll have your supper ready in the
shake of a sheep’s tail. By the time you’ve done
milking, anyway.”</p>

<p>Sam went out with the milk-buckets and
Jessie returned to the sitting-room. Her father
was at his desk, setting down some accounts;
her mother was watering the plants which had
lately been brought in and put in the south
windows. Jessie stood looking out into the
gathering twilight. Everything showed forth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
duskily. Many of the trees were shedding their
leaves. Down by the brook a row of willows
looked fantastically like people with big heads
and wild hair, Jessie thought. There was
one quite small, which seemed very human.
Jessie regarded it interestedly for some time before
she turned and said, “Mother, what is the
little tree down by the brook? the one with a
funny head. What’s its name?”</p>

<p>“Pollard Willow,” replied her mother, glancing
out of the window toward the place Jessie
pointed out.</p>

<p>“Polly Willow,” whispered Jessie to herself.
“Polly Willow! What a funny name.”</p>

<i>Playmate Polly</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was some time after this that Jessie made
the acquaintance of Polly Willow and it came
about in a way that Jessie had not expected. It
was due in the beginning to 589 which seemed
of late to be getting into a habit of tardiness.
One morning when Jessie was going to school
she missed her good friend Ezra at the door of
his little house. A stranger was there, a gruff
sort of somebody who cried out sharply: “Get
over there quick, sissy. You ain’t no business
crossing tracks when trains is coming.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t any train coming,” said Jessie.
“I know all about the trains. There isn’t any
after the 803 when 411 comes along. The next
train is at twelve and the one after at four.”</p>

<p>“Much you know,” replied the man. “I suppose
the president of the road has sent you a
special message saying he’s just changed the fall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
schedule. I had my information from Ezra, but
I reckon he don’t know. He told me to look out
for a train at 8:35.”</p>

<p>“There wasn’t any such train on Friday,” said
Jessie.</p>

<p>“Fall schedule hadn’t come into effect. Time
changes to-day.”</p>

<p>“Where is Ezra?” asked Jessie, still unbelieving,
but by this time safely across the track.</p>

<p>“Took down with rheumatiz. Been bothering
him on and off for some time. Now he’s laid up
in bed.”</p>

<p>“Dear me, but I am sorry,” said Jessie.</p>

<p>“That don’t cure his aches and pains,” returned
the man. “You’d better hustle along,
sis. I’ve got to signal to this here train and I
can’t stand here all day talking to you.”</p>

<p>Jessie turned away indignantly. Ezra would
have asked if she didn’t want to hold the flag
when the train went by, and he would not have
told her in that rude way to “go along.” She
did not like this man at all. She wondered if
Ezra would be ill all winter, and then suddenly
she thought of what her mother had said; that
if anything happened to Ezra, her parents would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
not feel that they could allow Jessie to take the
walk to the Hill School.</p>

<p>However, Ezra and the trains were forgotten
when the little girl reached school, for there
were several interesting things to take up her
thoughts that morning. In the first place, there
was a new scholar named Anna Sharp. She had
come to live with her aunt in the neighborhood
and was going to attend the Hill School. Next
Effie Hinsdale whispered that there were four
dear new kittens in the barn and that Jessie
could have one if she liked. Effie had been
given a demerit for whispering, and that had so
disturbed Jessie that she missed her geography
lesson and had to recite it after school, so altogether
there was quite enough to put Ezra out of
her mind.</p>

<p>She remembered him before she reached the
railroad, and then she determined that she would
not pay the least attention to the flagman who
was taking Ezra’s place, but that she would run
across the tracks without turning her head. She
had not resisted the temptation to stop at Effie’s
long enough to see the new kittens, and had
chosen the gray one, so that it was later than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
usual when she reached the railroad. Of course
589 must have gone by, for it was the express
and was due at four o’clock. There could not
be the least danger, thought Jessie. She saw
that the flagman had his back to her and was
standing looking up the track. She made haste
to cross before he could see her, and, in her
hurry, she tripped over the rail and her books
were scattered in every direction. She picked
herself up and was about to gather her books
together when she heard the shrill whistle of an
approaching train, while from up the track she
saw the express rapidly advancing upon her.
For a second she stood, numb with fright, and
then she leaped across the rails, her heart beating
fast. Another moment and the train went
flying by. She was safe if her books were not.
She saw her geography go careering down the
road, her arithmetic lying some distance away,
and her reader nowhere to be seen. But books
were of no account just then. The child’s whole
thought was to get home as quickly as possible.
Without looking back once she sped along as
fast as she could run, tears coursing down her
cheeks and herself so shaken that when she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
reached home she burst into the sitting-room and
flung herself, sobbing, into her mother’s arms.</p>

<p>“Why, my darling, what is the matter?”
asked Mrs. Loomis anxiously.</p>

<p>“589 was late and Ezra has the rheumatism
and they have changed the time and I tripped
on a rail and lost my books. There was a horrid
man there, too, and he called me ‘sis.’”</p>

<p>In this rather mixed-up speech her mother
recognized that something alarming had really
happened. “Never mind, dearie,” she said soothingly.
“Wait till you can stop crying and then
tell me all about it. Mother has you safe anyhow,
hasn’t she?” She cuddled the little girl
closely in her lap and in a few minutes Jessie
was able to give a better account of what had
occurred.</p>

<p>Mrs. Loomis looked very grave as she shook
her head. “Thank heaven,” she said, “that you
were not so bewildered as to stand still. We
didn’t know the winter schedule was in effect.
Ezra would have sent us word if he had not been
ill. Oh, my child!” She hugged Jessie suddenly
to her and after a moment continued, “It
is clear to me that it is not safe for you to go to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
school by yourself. I will see if we can arrange
to have Sam take you, and I might be able to
spare Minerva to bring you home. You could
go as far as the Hinsdales and wait there for
her. I should never have an easy moment if
you were to go over that road alone. Try to
forget this afternoon’s fright, dear child, and go
talk to Minerva. I see your father coming.”</p>

<p>Jessie went to Minerva and helped her feed
the chickens, almost forgetting in this task, that
she had been so frightened. But after supper
her father took her on his knee and questioned
her about the matter.</p>

<p>“No more school for you yet a while, miss,”
he said. “I can’t spare Sam just now for I am a
man short, and it won’t hurt you to stay at home
for a week while we plan what is to be done
next. I pinned my faith on Ezra, but now that
he is out of the question we shall have to think
of some other way of doing.”</p>

<p>So the next day Jessie stayed home from
school, and not only the next, but for several
days she was free to wander about the place and
do pretty much as she pleased. “She’s had a
bad fright,” said Mr. Loomis to his wife, “and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
she is a nervous, imaginative little thing, so she’d
better stay out-of-doors all she can till she gets
over this. I don’t think we need let her bother
with lessons for a while yet.”</p>

<p>The first day Jessie amused herself near the
house; the next she wandered as far as the
mountain cherry-tree; the third found her down
by the brook, and there she saw Polly Willow
waiting for her.</p>

<p>“I’ve just got to have somebody to play with,”
said Jessie, looking at Polly Willow’s funny head.
“I think maybe you’ll do for a playmate, Polly.
There’s one thing about it; you can’t run away
and you’ll always be here when I want you. Of
course you are pretty big, but so are the other
people in your family. You are much the smallest
of any of them, so I don’t suppose you are
any older than I. I think the first thing I do
must be to get you a hat. I know where there is
one I think I can have.”</p>

<p>She ran back to the house and up to the attic
where she found an old straw hat. On her way
down she stopped at the door of her mother’s
room to poke in her head and say: “May I
have this, mother?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“An old hat. I want to play with it.”</p>

<p>Her mother glanced at the hat. “Yes, you
may have it. Where are you playing?”</p>

<p>“Down by the brook.”</p>

<p>“Don’t get your feet wet. So long as you
have your rubbers on and are in the open air, I
am satisfied.”</p>

<p>With the hat in hand Jessie ran back to the
brook. The fallen leaves already dappled its
surface with red and yellow, but goldenrod and
asters made a gay fringe along the sides. Sitting
down on a fallen log she proceeded to trim
the hat with flowers. A plume of goldenrod
decorated one side; a bunch of asters the other,
and when it was finished, Jessie stood on tiptoe
and stuck the hat on Polly’s big head. “It’s
rather small for you,” she said as she gravely
regarded the effect, “but it makes you look more
like a little girl. Now, Polly, we’ll play. I’m
going to live over there.” She waved her hand
in the direction of a large rock a short distance
away. “I see Mrs. Mooky is coming to see me,
so I shall have to go, but I’ll come over again
after a while. Good-bye, Polly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>A pretty fawn-colored cow was grazing near
the big rock. This was the person Jessie called
Mrs. Mooky. The little girl was not in the least
afraid of cows, of this one in particular, for she
had been accustomed to seeing Mrs. Mooky ever
since she was a little calf which had fed from
her hand. So now she approached her boldly,
saying, “Good-morning, Mrs. Mooky. I’m very
glad to see you. I am sorry I was not at home
when you called just now, but I had to run over to
Polly’s. She has a new hat that she wanted me
to see.”</p>

<p>The cow lifted her head and gave a gentle
“moo.”</p>

<p>“I understand,” Jessie went on. “You’ll
come again some other day. Very well. Good-bye.”
And the cow moved on. “I’m going to
ask mother if I can’t have a tea-party here with
Playmate Polly. No, I won’t say with Playmate
Polly; she might laugh. A grown person couldn’t
exactly understand how nice it is to have a Playmate
Polly for a friend. I’ll bring one of the
dolls, and—oh, dear, I wish the gray kitten
were big enough. Mother says I can’t have it
till it is quite able to do without its mother,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
so I’ll have to wait, and I shall have to get
Charity.”</p>

<p>Again she went back to the house, this time
to get the doll which had been bought at a
bazaar in the city by Jessie’s aunt who had suggested
the old-fashioned name of Charity for her,
since it was a charity bazaar at which she had
been bought, and because the doll was dressed
in a very old-fashioned costume to represent a
Colonial Dame. She had now a long cloak to
cover her brocade frock, a cloak that Jessie had
made from a piece of gray flannel, and in consequence
of her having this warm garment, Jessie
thought her better prepared for outdoor play
than the other dolls.</p>

<p>“May I have something for a party? I’m
taking Charity with me down to the brook,”
she said to her mother whom she found in the
kitchen.</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” said her mother, “what do you
want?”</p>

<p>“What is it that smells so good?”</p>

<p>“Peach marmalade, I suspect. We’re making
some.”</p>

<p>“I’d like some of that on some bread.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>“It’s hot,” said Minerva, “and it isn’t done
yet, but I reckon it will taste good and it will
soon cool off in the open air. What will you
have it in? Oh, I know; one of those little jars
the beef extract comes in. There are some in
the pantry on the shelf behind the door.”</p>

<p>Jessie set Charity on one of the kitchen chairs,
and went to the pantry for the little jar which
Minerva filled with marmalade. She then cut a
couple slices of bread, buttered them and put
them wrapped in a napkin, into a small egg
basket, adding the jar of preserves and an apple.
“Be careful how you carry it,” she warned Jessie.
“You don’t want to smear that sticky stuff all
over the basket, and be sure to bring it and the
jar back when you come. Now, don’t forget.”</p>

<p>“I’ll remember,” said Jessie. “Thank you,
Minerva. I shall have a lovely time.”</p>

<p>“Here, come back,” cried Minerva, as Jessie
went out. “I didn’t put in any spoon. Would
you rather have a spoon or a knife?”</p>

<p>“A spoon, I think,” said Jessie, “for then if I
want to eat any preserves I can do it easier, and
a spoon will do to spread with, too.”</p>

<p>“One of the kitchen spoons, Minerva,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
Mrs. Loomis. “We don’t want the silver lost at
the bottom of the brook.”</p>

<p>Jessie was quite satisfied with a kitchen spoon
and went happily on her way, holding the little
basket and her doll, carefully. “We’re going
over to Playmate Polly’s, Charity,” she informed
her doll. “You don’t know her, but she is a very
nice little girl, just the kind I like. She knows
all about the flowers and birds and such things,
for she lives right down by the brook where they
live. She told me this morning that she is very
intimate with the birds especially, and now that
they are going south for the winter she would be
very lonely if I didn’t play with her. I think
she will be glad to see you, too, for I am sure she
doesn’t have much company these days. Mrs.
Mooky comes pretty often, but then she is not a
little girl like me, and that makes a great difference.”</p>

<p>Talking thus to her doll, she went on her way
and soon reached the brook. The marmalade
was still warm, but when it was spread on the
bread which Jessie laid out on the red doily, it
soon cooled, and if Jessie was obliged to eat both
Polly’s and Charity’s share by proxy, she did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
have to eat for the birds, who were glad of the
crumbs, and who, when the last speck had vanished,
came near enough to look inquiringly with
their bright eyes as if to ask, Is that all?</p>

<p>“Now, Polly,” said Jessie, “I’m going to ask
you to take care of Charity for me a little while.
She isn’t very well this morning, and I want to
see the doctor about her. You know Dr. Bramble,
of course.”</p>

<p>Polly, answering in Jessie’s voice, said she
knew Dr. Bramble very well indeed, that he was
a sharp sort of person, and often very disagreeable,
but that he was a good doctor and his
cordial fine stuff.</p>

<p>So, leaving Charity in Polly’s care, Jessie went
to hunt up Dr. Bramble. She was obliged to
stay quite a while for when she reached his house
she found that Mrs. Bramble had a few belated
blackberries for her, and they were so tempting
that Jessie was obliged to gather them all.
“They’ll do finely for pills for Charity,” she said,
“or maybe I’d better make medicine of them; I
can mash them in the jar with the spoon and give
her a teaspoonful at a time!”</p>

<p>The berries were rather hard and could not be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
easily crushed, but finally Jessie accomplished the
work and Charity was given her first dose,
though she cried a good deal over it and insisted
that she could not take it. “But you must, my
dear,” said Jessie firmly, “or you will not get
well. Do you want to be ill and not have any
more of the nice marmalade Minerva is making?”</p>

<p>Charity deciding that she preferred marmalade
to illness, at last took the medicine by means of
Jessie’s mouth, and was then put to bed and
covered up with leaves. Then Jessie amused herself
a long while with Playmate Polly. They
talked about many things; the birds, the fishes,
the flowers, the gray kitten and of Charity’s illness,
and the time went so pleasantly that when
the dinner horn sounded Jessie had no idea that
it was so late. She had enjoyed her morning
hugely, and had come to have a great affection
for her new friend, Playmate Polly.</p>

<p class="ph3"><i>CHAPTER III</i><br>

<i>The Neighbor of the Yellow House</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Every</span> morning after this Jessie went down
to the brook to play with Playmate Polly.
Charity soon recovered from her illness, Dr.
Bramble’s medicine being the very thing for her,
and she was able to enjoy her share of the scrapings
of marmalade which Jessie ate for her from
the big preserving-kettle. Mrs. Mooky called
frequently, and so did other persons. Jessie
made the acquaintance of a lively cricket which
lived under the big stone that she was accustomed
to call her house, and she also had several conversations
with a fat toad which would come out
and blink at her on mild days. Still it was Playmate
Polly whom Jessie liked the best. She
kept the knowledge of this queer friend a secret
from everybody, and for that very reason probably
enjoyed her the more.</p>

<p>One afternoon, however, when she and Polly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
had been having a particularly interesting talk,
Jessie heard a laugh from the other side of the
brook, and looking up quickly she saw a little
girl with very black hair and eyes, astride a fallen
log. “Hello!” said the little girl.</p>

<p>Jessie looked at her interestedly. “Hello!”
she responded. She had never seen the little girl
before;—not at church, nor on the road, nor anywhere,
and she wondered who she could be.
“Who are you?” she asked presently, “and how
did you get over there?”</p>

<p>“I’m Adele Pauline Falaise Hallett,” was the
reply, “and I got here by walking.”</p>

<p>“Goodness! what a long name,” said Jessie.
“Do you live near here?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I live in the yellow house this side the
bridge.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know now,” returned Jessie; “you’re
the new people. Did you come through the
woods or by the road?”</p>

<p>“Through the woods. What’s your name?”</p>

<p>“Jessie Loomis.”</p>

<p>“Who was it that you’ve been talking to all
this time? I looked and listened for ever so long
and I couldn’t see anybody.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>“I was talking to my doll, Charity, part of the
time,” said Jessie, after a little hesitation. She
did not want to tell her secrets to a stranger.</p>

<p>“Who is Polly Somebody? You kept saying
Polly this and Polly that. Hare you a parrot
over there?”</p>

<p>“Dear me, no,” returned Jessie. “I was talking
to a make-believe friend of mine.”</p>

<p>“What kind of friend? Can’t you see her
truly?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I can see her. She’s this tree.” Jessie
laid her hand affectionately on Playmate Polly’s
rough bark.</p>

<p>Adele laughed. “That’s a mighty funny sort
of friend. I’m coming over to you. Where can
I get across?”</p>

<p>“There’s a log higher up,” Jessie told her. “I
cross that way sometimes, and in summer when
the brook is very low I can cross on the stones.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t so very low now.”</p>

<p>“No, and so you’d better try the log. I’ll
show you where it is.” She took the path on one
side the brook, Adele following that on the other,
and pretty soon they came to a log thrown across
the stream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>“It’s a little wobbly,” said Jessie, “so you’d
better be careful.”</p>

<p>With some small shrieks and exclamations
Adele managed to cross the bridge without mishap.
“Now show me where you play,” she said
somewhat commandingly, Jessie thought, and
therefore she led the way silently to her favorite
spot.</p>

<p>“This is Playmate Polly,” she said as if introducing
a friend.</p>

<p>Adele laughed. “What do you call it that for?”</p>

<p>“Because it is her name,” rejoined Jessie
stoutly, as she turned toward the big stone near
by. “This is my house,” she went on; “it is
where Charity and I live. Charity is my doll.”</p>

<p>Adele, without answering, picked up Charity
and looked her over. “She wears mighty queer
clothes,” she remarked after a moment.</p>

<p>“That’s because she is a Colonial Dame,” returned
Jessie in a superior tone.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Adele, setting down Charity carefully.
She did not know just what a Colonial
Dame was and did not want to show her ignorance.
“What do you call her Charity for?” she
asked presently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>“My Aunt Lucy bought her at a charity
bazaar, and she said as Charity was one of the
old-fashioned names, she thought it would suit
an old-fashioned doll. I like it,” she added with
decision.</p>

<p>“I knew a girl once named Temperance,” remarked
Adele. “They used to call her Tempy.”</p>

<p>“Where was that?”</p>

<p>“In New Orleans where I lived before we
came here; before—” she hesitated, and then
added in a low voice, “before I lost my mother.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Jessie gazed at her with sympathetic
eyes. She had never known, before this, any
little girl who had not a mother. “Was it very
long ago?” she asked softly.</p>

<p>“A little over a year,” Adele told her. “I
have six dolls,” she went on, changing the subject.
“How many have you?”</p>

<p>“Five, but I like Charity the best. She is the
biggest and prettiest, too. I have one a little
smaller named Lucy, and a little China boy-doll
I like very much; he is about so high.” She
measured a height of four inches or so. “I
bring him down here because he is so little that
I can put him most anywhere.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>“What is his name?” asked Adele.</p>

<p>“Peter Pan,” returned Jessie. “Then I have
a baby in long clothes and a German doll my
uncle brought me when he came from Europe.”</p>

<p>It seemed a very interesting family to Adele
who said regretfully, “My dolls are so much
alike I don’t care much more for one than another.
Some are newer than others; that’s all.
Will you show me all your dolls some day?”</p>

<p>“Why, certainly,” returned Jessie warmly,
adding, “I’m awfully glad you live near.
There’s no one this side the bridge at all.
Effie Hinsdale is the nearest, but she lives across
the railroad track.”</p>

<p>“Aunt Betty won’t let me cross it,” said
Adele.</p>

<p>“I used to do it every day; that was before
Ezra had rheumatism. I don’t go to school now.
Do you go to the Hill school?” Jessie asked,
then added, “Oh, no, of course you don’t, if you
can’t cross the railroad track.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t go anywhere,” returned Adele.
“I am going to have a governess next week.”</p>

<p>“Shall you like that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. I like Miss Eloise. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
is a friend of my aunt’s and she is very nice and
kind, at least she is now.”</p>

<p>“I thought governesses were always cross,”
said Jessie as if it were a well-known fact.</p>

<p>“Maybe she will be when she gets to be a
governess,” Adele remarked. “I hope she will
not. I believe I’d rather not have her anyway.
I hate lessons.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” returned Jessie delightedly. “I’m
so glad you feel that way. I was so pleased
when I knew I could stay at home for a while.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to stay away from school
always?” asked Adele.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am sure I don’t know. I suppose we
have to have educations, but it is very disagreeable.
I don’t see why educations can’t come like
teeth, when you’re ready for them, or an easier
way still would be to wake up some morning and
find you could do every example in the arithmetic,
and another morning you could speak French,
and another you would know all the rivers and
capitals and mountains and things. Wouldn’t
that be fine?”</p>

<p>Adele laughed. “I wake up every morning
and know I can speak French.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>“Oh, do you?” Jessie looked at her half incredulously.
“I didn’t know any little girls
could do that unless they were real French children
who couldn’t speak English. How does it
happen?”</p>

<p>“My grandmother was French. I am named
after her,” Adele told her, “and my mother
spoke French as well as English. I always
had a French nurse, too, so I learned French
at the same time I did English.”</p>

<p>Jessie looked at her admiringly, then she
sighed. “Well, I don’t know a word of French
or anything except ‘Guten Tag.’ We had a
German to work for us once and he taught me
that much.”</p>

<p>“Don’t let’s talk about such stupid things,” said
Adele suddenly. “What is behind those branches
piled up against that place in the bank here?”</p>

<p>Jessie looked at her quickly. It seemed as if
Adele’s quick eyes and ears would discover all
her secrets. “You won’t tell?” she asked after
a minute’s pause. “Cross your heart you won’t?
It’s a secret, you see. Playmate Polly is a
secret, too. Not even mother or Minerva know
about her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>“I promise,” said Adele readily. “Who is
Minerva?”</p>

<p>“Our girl. She is as nice as she can be. I’m
awfully fond of her.”</p>

<p>“Show me what is behind the branches.”</p>

<p>Jessie led the way to the spot where the bank
dropped three or four feet. She carefully removed
the branches, saying mysteriously: “It
is a cave, a grotto.”</p>

<p>Adele knelt down and peeped in to see where
the bank, shelving in, made quite a little hollow.
The floor of the small grotto was paved with
pebbles upon which lay rugs of green moss. A
piece of looking-glass set in the earth served for
a tiny lake. The sides of the grotto were hung
with another kind of moss. At one end two
small candlesticks, bearing red candles, were set
up and in a chair between them was the little
china doll.</p>

<p>“This is where Peter Pan lives,” said Jessie.
“I’ll light the candles and you can see the lake
better. That pile of moss over there is Peter
Pan’s bed. I haven’t any table for him yet. I
am hunting for a nice little square block of wood,
or a smooth round stone would do. I haven’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
really finished the grotto yet Don’t you think
it is right pretty?”</p>

<p>“It is perfectly beautiful,” said Adele enthusiastically.
“I don’t see how you did it.
Oh, won’t you let me come and play with you
sometimes?”</p>

<p>Jessie felt that she was very generous to be
sharing her secrets with a stranger, but when
she remembered that Adele was motherless she
felt that anything she could do to give her
pleasure would be a small thing, so she responded
cordially, “Why, of course.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t any little doll like Peter Pan,”
Adele went on, “but maybe a paper doll would
do till I could get the right kind.”</p>

<p>“A paper doll would do very well and you
could call her Wendy,” said Jessie with satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t you know Peter Pan? I thought
every one did,” said Jessie in surprise.</p>

<p>“Please tell me.”</p>

<p>“All right, I will. I know all about him.
When I went to see Aunt Lucy last winter she
took me to see Peter Pan, and oh, it was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
loveliest thing you can imagine. Sit down here
and I will tell you.” Adele did as she was told
and Jessie launched forth into her story, Adele
listening attentively.</p>

<p>But before the story was finished a shrill
whistle sounded from the house. “Oh, dear,”
said Jessie jumping up, “I must go. That is
for me.”</p>

<p>“How do you know it is for you?”</p>

<p>“Mother has a little whistle that she blows
whenever she wants me to come home.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you just stay long enough to finish the
story?” said Adele coaxingly. “Please do.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I couldn’t. There is a lot more, and
mother doesn’t like me to stay out too late.”</p>

<p>“She won’t mind just this once.”</p>

<p>Jessie hesitated and glanced toward the house.
Again the whistle sounded.</p>

<p>Hastily gathering up Peter Pan and Charity
she made ready to return home.</p>

<p>“I think you are real mean,” cried Adele.
“You just get into the most interesting part
and then you stop. I don’t like you one bit.
I’m just going home and you can talk to your
old dumb Polly after this.” She stalked away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
indignantly while Jessie slowly made her way
toward the house, looking back every little
while over her shoulder. She knew she was
doing right, but she did wish Adele had not
gone off in a huff. After all, perhaps Playmate
Polly was more satisfactory, for she never quarreled
with her. This thought made her turn
and run back a few steps to call out: “Good-night,
Polly.”</p>

<p>Just then she heard a scream and some one
crying out: “Jessie, Jessie!” in tones of distress.
For only a second Jessie hesitated and
then she rushed to the spot from which the voice
came to find Adele splashing about in the brook.</p>

<p>“I slipped off the log,” she cried. “I’m all
wet and drownded and there is a cow coming!”</p>

<p>Fortunately the brook was not very deep, particularly
at this point. Jessie laid down her
dolls, and went to the bank near the log, reaching
out her hands and calling to Adele, “Come
up here.”</p>

<p>Adele cast a frightened look over her shoulder
at Mrs. Mooky, who was taking an evening drink
from the stream. “She won’t hurt you, will
you, Mrs. Mooky?” said Jessie encouragingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>The cow lifted her head and looked fixedly at
Jessie, moving a few steps nearer.</p>

<p>“Oh, she’s coming! She’s coming!” cried
Adele frantically trying to scramble up the bank.</p>

<p>“No, she isn’t,” Jessie assured her. “Give
me your hand. There now, you are safe, but
you are awfully wet. Come right home with
me and get some dry clothes.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” protested Adele, “I’ll go home.”</p>

<p>“It’s further to your house. You’d better
come,” said Jessie decidedly.</p>

<p>“It was all that horrid cow,” said Adele.
“She came splashing down into the water and
scared me so my foot slipped and down I went.”</p>

<p>Jessie smiled. She could not imagine any one
being afraid of Mrs. Mooky, but she saw that
Adele was really frightened so she only repeated:
“You’d better come home with me.”</p>

<p>“What will your mother say?” said Adele,
still holding back.</p>

<p>“She’ll say she’s very sorry it happened, and
she’ll have Minerva take you home unless Sam
is there with the carriage. Father went to town
to-day and maybe Sam hasn’t gone to meet him
yet. Come right along; you’ll get cold.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>Thus admonished, Adele allowed herself to be
led up to the house. Mrs. Loomis met the two
little girls at the porch steps. “This is Adele
Hallett,” said Jessie. “She lives in the yellow
house, and she slipped off the log into the brook
just now. Mrs. Mooky frightened her.”</p>

<p>“That was very unkind of Mrs. Mooky,” said
Mrs. Loomis smiling down at Adele. “Come in,
dear. You must be chilled to the bone in those
wet clothes. There is a good fire in the sitting-room.
I always like to have it bright and cheery
for Jessie’s father when he comes in. Take your
friend in there, Jessie, and I will go up for some
dry clothes.”</p>

<p>The open wood-fire was sending out a comforting
heat as Adele shiveringly came up to it.
“You’d better take off your shoes and stockings
first; they are the wettest,” Jessie told her.
“Your feet must be very cold. I’ll take off one
shoe and you do the other.”</p>

<p>Adele sat down meekly on the big fur rug,
while Jessie helped her to take off her wet foot
gear. “There,” said Jessie, “stick out your feet
and get them good and hot while I unbutton
your frock.” Adele obeyed without a word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>Presently Mrs. Loomis returned with the dry
things and bade Jessie take the wet ones to
Minerva to dry. “We’ll send them home to
you,” she told Adele as she helped her into
Jessie’s garments. They were a little large for
her, but they did very well.</p>

<p>Jessie laughed when she came back. “It is
another me, isn’t it, mother?” she said. “Only
that me isn’t as big as this me, and it has black
hair instead of light brown, and black eyes instead
of blue. Do you feel as if your name were
Jessie, and are you real warm, Adele?”</p>

<p>“I feel quite warm,” said Adele in a low voice,
her head drooping.</p>

<p>“I’m going to mix something good and hot
for her to drink,” said Mrs. Loomis, “and then
Sam can take her home. Miss Hallett will be
anxious about her, and Sam is about ready to go
to the station to meet your father.”</p>

<p>As soon as Mrs. Loomis had left the room
Adele lifted her eyes, and Jessie saw that they
were full of tears. “I said I didn’t like you one
bit,” she burst out, “but I do, I do. I love you.
I love you dearly.”</p>

<p>“Oh!—why——” Jessie began. She felt embarrassed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
and was glad of her mother’s reappearance.
Mrs. Loomis held a glass in her hand.
“Drink this, dear,” she said to Adele. “You
will find that it tastes very good and it will keep
you from taking cold.” Adele silently obeyed,
and found it a spicy-sweet draught which sent a
warm glow through her.</p>

<p>Jessie pulled her mother’s head down to her
level and whispered something to her. Mrs.
Loomis nodded understandingly and when Adele
set down the glass she lifted the child’s face and
kissed her gently on the cheek. “You must come
again,” she said.</p>

<p>“And will you take me to see her?” asked
Jessie eagerly.</p>

<p>“To be sure I will,” replied Mrs. Loomis. “I
am going to call on your aunt, dear,” she said to
Adele, “and I hope we shall all be good friends
and neighbors.”</p>

<p>Adele looked at her for a moment and then she
caught her hand and laid her own cheek against
it. “You are lovely,” she said, “and Jessie is just
like you. I want her to be my friend forever.”</p>

<p>Then Minerva appeared at the door to say that
Sam was ready with the carriage.</p>

<i>Aunt Betty</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next day there was no sign of Adele,
though from time to time Jessie looked up from
her play to see if her new friend by chance might
be coming along the path on the other side of the
brook. Sam had delivered the little girl’s belongings
at the yellow house, and had been told
that none of the family were up. Later Jessie’s
clothes were returned with a note of thanks. So
Playmate Polly had it all her own way that day,
and Peter Pan was provided with more moss
hangings as well as a new ornament in the shape
of a bright pink pebble for his grotto. Jessie
had told her mother all that she had learned
about Adele and had received some information
in return. Miss Betty Hallett, Adele’s aunt, was
a delicate woman, and Adele herself was not
strong, so the doctor had declared they would
both be better in the country, and as Mr. Hallett
had removed his business from the south to the
middle states he had discovered in the yellow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
house by the brook, just the place which he
thought would suit his sister and his little daughter.
It was not so far from the city where he had
his office but that he could come home frequently
to spend Sunday, and it was in a healthful region
as well as a very attractive one.</p>

<p>“So now,” Mrs. Loomis told Jessie, “I must
call on Miss Hallett at once, for we are her nearest
neighbors and I am sure she must be lonely.”</p>

<p>They set off, therefore, one afternoon, in the
little phaeton which Mrs. Loomis always drove
herself, and soon they drew up before the yellow
house and were ushered into a room filled with
stately old furniture and sombre portraits. “I
don’t think it is as cozy as our house,” whispered
Jessie.</p>

<p>“Hush, dear,” returned Mrs. Loomis. “It is
far handsomer, and probably after a while it will
look more cheerful. You see everything is not
settled.”</p>

<p>At this moment Miss Hallett entered and Jessie
shrank back against her mother, surprise and
something like horror in her eyes, for she saw a
tiny little woman with deep dark eyes, a mournful
mouth and rather a large head set down between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
her shoulders. Jessie had never come in
contact with a hunchback before and she gripped
her mother’s hand hard. Mrs. Loomis gave her
fingers a gentle pressure before she rose to meet
Miss Hallett whose sudden smile lighted up her
sallow face. “I hope we are not coming to you
before you are ready to receive a call,” said Mrs.
Loomis. “We are your nearest neighbors, Miss
Hallett, and I hope you will believe that we want
to be true ones.”</p>

<p>“I am so glad to see you,” returned Miss Hallett.
“This dull day has given me an attack of
the blues, and you could not have chosen a better
time for coming. I have been wanting an opportunity
to thank you for your kindness to Adele,
but we have been so busy, it seemed impossible
for me to find time to go anywhere. Adele has
talked of nothing else but you and your little girl
since her rather awkward tumble. I am afraid
she gave you a great deal of trouble.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” returned Mrs. Loomis. “I
only hope she didn’t take cold.”</p>

<p>“No, she did not, thanks to your prompt
measures. She is an impulsive, headstrong little
creature, and I am at loss sometimes just how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
to manage her. Fortunately my friend Miss
Laurent has consented to come to us, and with
her coöperation I hope we shall do great things
for Adele. I wanted to have the house all in
order before Miss Laurent should come, and it
has been such a task.”</p>

<p>Jessie wished very much that Miss Hallett
would send for Adele instead of talking about
her, and presently was relieved when a tall
mulatto woman was summoned. “Go tell Miss
Adele that she is to come in, Angeline,” said
Miss Hallett. “Or,” she turned to Mrs. Loomis,
“perhaps your little girl would rather go out to
Adele. She is in the summer-house. My brother
has had it enclosed with glass, and Adele rather
likes to play there. Would you rather go to
Adele?” she asked Jessie.</p>

<p>There was no doubt in Jessie’s mind that she
would very much prefer this, and in another moment
she was following Angeline through the
hall to a side door and down a broad walk to the
summer-house.</p>

<p>“Young lady to see you, honey baby,” said
Angeline putting her head in the door.</p>

<p>Adele, who was busy over something in one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
corner, turned suddenly and caught sight of
Jessie standing on the sill. She darted forward,
and flung her arms around her visitor, kissing
her first on one cheek and then on the other.
“I am so glad you have come,” she cried. “I
thought you never would. You may go, Angeline.”
She turned to the tall maid who drew
down her mouth and disappeared leaving the
little girls alone.</p>

<p>“I thought of course you would come over
yesterday, to the play place, you know,” returned
Jessie.</p>

<p>Adele dropped her eyes and appeared to be
looking attentively at her toes. “I couldn’t,”
she said presently.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“She wouldn’t let me.”</p>

<p>“What she?”</p>

<p>“Aunt Betty. She’s horrid like that sometimes
and is just as mean as she can be.”</p>

<p>“Is that because she isn’t—she isn’t just like
other people?” asked Jessie hesitatingly. She
could readily understand that a person who
looked like Miss Hallett might have reason to
be disagreeable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>Adele looked at her fixedly for a moment,
then to Jessie’s great discomfiture she burst into
tears. “She isn’t! She isn’t! She isn’t!” she
repeated. “She is just like other people and she
is dear and good and lovely. You shan’t say she
is not.”</p>

<p>Jessie was bewildered. “I didn’t mean—I
didn’t mean——” she began helplessly.</p>

<p>“It was I who was horrid,” Adele went on.
“It was all my doing. I got mad and screamed
and fought Angeline and wouldn’t eat my supper
because I couldn’t have coffee and lots, lots,
lots of sugar in it, and so Aunt Betty said I
shouldn’t go to see you till she said I might.
She isn’t horrid at all, and you shan’t say she is.
She is perfectly beautiful.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t <i>I</i> who said she was horrid, you
know,” said Jessie with an emphasis on the <i>I</i>.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t care. You thought so.”
Adele wiped her eyes and stood thoughtfully
picking off the dead leaves from a potted geranium
on a shelf near by. Jessie was silent.
She hardly knew whether to go or stay.</p>

<p>Presently Adele turned around with the
sweetest of smiles. “Let’s play,” she said.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
“I’ll show you all my dolls. Why didn’t you
bring Charity or Peter Pan with you?”</p>

<p>“I will next time,” said Jessie, relieved at the
turn of affairs, but wondering what kind of girl
Adele really was.</p>

<p>“Come,” cried Adele, grasping Jessie’s hand.
“The dolls are all up in the playroom. I was
making medicine for them just now. They have
ague, every blessed one of them, and they are
shaking their heads off, at least one of them is,”
she added with a laugh. “I’ll show you which
one it is.” She pulled Jessie along the boardwalk
and up-stairs to a pleasant upper room
where six dolls were abed, most of them staring
smilingly at the ceiling, though two of them had
their eyes shut. Adele picked up one of them
and showed a very wobbly head which seemed
in danger of soon departing from its body.
“This is the shakiest one,” she said, “and she’ll
have to have a double dose of medicine. Indeed,
I don’t know but that she will have to go
to a hospital. That is my newest one.” She
pointed to a very fresh and smiling flaxen-haired
beauty.</p>

<p>“What is her name?” asked Jessie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>“She hasn’t any in particular. I never name
my dolls.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t you?” This seemed as incredible
to Jessie as if she had been told that a family of
children had been left unnamed. “I don’t see
how you get along if you don’t name them,” she
said.</p>

<p>“Oh, I scarcely ever play with more than one
at a time, and then I can always call that one
dolly or honey or something,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“I should think you would have to name
them,” persisted Jessie. “When you are talking
about them what do you say?”</p>

<p>“I hardly ever do talk about them. When I
do it is to Aunt Betty, and then I say the new
doll, or the doll with the brown hair, or something
of that kind. Don’t let’s play with dolls.
I bet you can’t catch me before I get downstairs.”
And while Jessie was recovering herself
Adele was off and away down the stairs at the
foot of which she stood laughing as Jessie descended
more slowly. “I think I shall ask
Angeline for some cakes,” she said. “Come
along into the kitchen. I suppose that cross old
Roxy wouldn’t give us any, but I can coax Angeline<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
into anything. Angeline! Angeline!” she
called imperiously, “come here.”</p>

<p>Angeline appeared at the entry door. “I want
some cakes,” said Adele, “some for Jessie and
me. We’re hungry.”</p>

<p>“Dey ain’ no mo’ cakes, honey,” said Angeline.
“Yo done eat ’em all up.”</p>

<p>“Then make some right away, or tell Roxy
she’s got to do it.”</p>

<p>“Roxy she done gone to de sto’.”</p>

<p>“Oh, bother! You go along and make
some, and be quick about it, too,” ordered
Adele.</p>

<p>“Law, honey chile, how long yuh spec’ it tek
to mek up de fiah an’ bake cake? Yuh foolish,
chile. I done got some sweet ertaters in de
ashes,” she hastened to say as she saw Adele’s
face puckering up for a cry. “I tell yuh what,
honey; I git yuh two nice bowls o’ milk an’ nice
sweet ertaters an’ yuh kin tek ’em out in de
summah-house an’ eat ’em.”</p>

<p>“I suppose that will have to do,” said Adele
with resignation. “Do you like sweet potatoes
and milk?” she asked Jessie.</p>

<p>“I never ate any. At least, of course I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
eaten sweet potatoes often enough and I drink
milk, but I never ate them together.”</p>

<p>“They are mighty good together,” Adele
assured her. “Bring ’em along, Angeline, to the
summer-house, and don’t you be forever about it
either.” And Adele stalked off with Jessie in
her wake.</p>

<p>“She’s very good-natured, isn’t she?” remarked
Jessie when they had reached the summer-house.</p>

<p>“Who? Angeline? Oh, so so.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t dare to talk to Minerva that way,”
said Jessie after a pause.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t? I don’t see why. I always
talk as I please to Angeline. She nursed my
mother and she nursed me, and she doesn’t care
what I say to her. Besides, I am her mistress.”
Adele held her head high, and Jessie looked at
her admiringly.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said, “I suppose that must make
a difference; Minerva was never nurse to my
mother.”</p>

<p>The two bowls of milk and warm sweet potatoes
soon appeared and though Jessie did not
care very much for the combination, she ate part
of her share fearing she might seem rude if she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
did not. She was glad, however, that she did
not have to finish, and that a message from her
mother obliged her to return to the house.</p>

<p>“We must go now, dear,” said Mrs. Loomis.
“We have made a long call.” She smiled at
Adele as the two little girls came in.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, you mustn’t go,” spoke up Adele.
“At least, you might let Jessie stay. Won’t you,
please?”</p>

<p>“Not to-day,” said Mrs. Loomis gently.
“Your aunt has been kind enough to promise that
we may have you to-morrow to spend the day, so I
think Jessie and I will have to say good-bye now.”</p>

<p>“Oh, am I going for the whole day?” exclaimed
Adele delightedly, catching her aunt’s
hand and pressing her cheek against it as was
her way of doing. “Is Angeline going to take
me, or can I go alone? I know the way.”</p>

<p>“You may go over alone,” Miss Betty told her.
“But I will send Angeline for you.”</p>

<p>Remembering Adele’s outburst earlier in the
afternoon, Jessie steeled herself to move closer
to Miss Hallett and to say, “I’m glad you will
let Adele come. I haven’t any little girls to
play with, you see.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>“Oh, yes, you have,” put in Adele with mischief
in her eyes; “you have Playmate Polly,
you know.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Loomis looked down with a puzzled expression.
“Who in the world is Playmate
Polly?” she asked. “I never heard of her.”</p>

<p>“She is a horrid creature,” said Adele laughing.
“She has scraggy hair, and a dreadful rough
skin, but Jessie is very fond of her, and I don’t
like her to be.”</p>

<p>Jessie hung her head. She was afraid of being
laughed at. “She’s only a tree,” she said in
a low voice.</p>

<p>Miss Betty smiled, but Mrs. Loomis put her
arm around her little daughter and said: “Then
I am sure she is a very harmless acquaintance,
who will set my little girl no bad examples, and
I am sure she is much better than no one.”</p>

<p>Jessie looked up with a grateful smile. Mother
always understood. She would tell her all about
Polly now that it was a secret no longer. Yet
she felt hurt and offended to think that Adele
had not kept faith with her, though, as she reflected,
it was not about Polly that her promise
was made, but about Peter Pan and his grotto.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
Adele knew, however, that Jessie wanted both
kept a secret, and so the little visitor threw her
hostess a reproachful look which Adele understood
and eagerly responded to by saying, “I
didn’t tell about the other thing, Jessie. Indeed
I didn’t. Now that you have me, I
didn’t suppose you would care any more about
Polly.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Loomis was too considerate to ask about
“the other thing,” but she was told all about Playmate
Polly on the way home, and agreed with
Jessie that it was very well to have such an
amiable friend when there was danger of a sudden
flare up from Adele.</p>

<p>“The poor child has no mother; we must be
very patient with her,” Mrs. Loomis said. “She
has always been a delicate little thing, and in
consequence is greatly spoiled. Her aunt is very
frail, too, and says she cannot stand scenes. I
hope Miss Laurent will have wisdom enough to
know how to manage such a wilful little girl.
Miss Hallett tells me that her friend is a very
superior woman and that she hopes a great deal
from her.” She was silent for a few minutes
while Barney carried them several rods along<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
the road. Then she said, “What do you think
of having lessons with Adele, daughter?”</p>

<p>“Oh! Why, I don’t know. I suppose if I
have to have lessons at all that it would be nicer
than anything. Am I to do it, mother?”</p>

<p>“I think so. I shall have to speak to your
father first, but Miss Hallett is very eager to
have such an arrangement and brought up the
subject herself, so I do not see but that we shall
profit by it. She is very anxious that Adele
should have a companion, for she has been too
much with older persons, and it would certainly
settle our difficulty of lessons for you.”</p>

<p>This gave Jessie a great deal to think about
all that evening, and the last question she asked
that night was, “Will you promise to tell me
first thing in the morning, mother?”</p>

<p>And her mother answered, “I promise.”</p>

<i>A New Pet</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> Mrs. Loomis had said, Miss Hallett’s proposition
settled the question of lessons for Jessie,
and so when Adele appeared the next morning,
bright and early, Jessie had the great piece of
news to tell her, and Adele responded in her
usual tempestuous way by giving Jessie a tremendous
hug, and by rushing to Mrs. Loomis to
embrace her, too. “It will be perfectly lovely,”
she cried. “You will come to my house every
morning and we’ll have lessons in the playroom;
it will have to be a workroom then, and in the
afternoon we can play by the brook.”</p>

<p>“We’ll not be able to all winter,” said Jessie,
“for it will be too cold.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I forgot that; we don’t have much winter
down our way, you know.”</p>

<p>“Of course I don’t mean that we can never
play out-of-doors,” returned Jessie, “but it will
be too damp down by the brook most of the
time, and it will often be too snowy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>“Oh, the snow! I long for it,” cried Adele
clasping her hands.</p>

<p>“It is nice,” said Jessie. “I like to slide on
the ice, too, even when it isn’t snowy. We can
often go out on the little pond when the ice is
thick. It is rather fun to be out in the cold at
any time, for you feel so good when you come in.”</p>

<p>“I shall get Miss Eloise to let me walk home
with you sometimes,” said Adele, “because you
will have to come by yourself in the morning,
and it wouldn’t be fair for you to walk both ways
alone. Does the brook freeze over?”</p>

<p>“Sometimes,” Jessie told her, “and then we
can cross on the ice. I’d rather go that way always,
for it is shorter than to go around by the
road, but I suppose I can’t in very bad weather.”</p>

<p>“What will you do about Polly when it gets
cold?” asked Adele.</p>

<p>“Oh, I can always see her except when there is
deep snow.”</p>

<p>“And the grotto?”</p>

<p>“I’ll have to cover it up with brush and it will
be there in the spring. Why did you tell my
secret, Adele?”</p>

<p>“Because I don’t like Polly. I didn’t tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
about the grotto, did I? and I think Polly is ugly.
I wish you didn’t like her.”</p>

<p>“Anyhow, she never tells things I don’t want
her to,” said Jessie severely.</p>

<p>Adele buried her head in the sofa cushion of
the lounge upon which she was sitting, and began
to sob, “I don’t care, I don’t care. She is nothing
but an ugly wicked old tree, and you <i>shall</i>
love me best, because I love you best. I don’t
pick out queer bad old creatures like that to love
more than you. I believe she is nothing but an
old witch.”</p>

<p>For a moment Jessie felt quite remorseful, but
then a feeling of not wanting to be forced into
likes and dislikes took possession of her, and she
relentlessly said: “I shall not like you best if
you tell my secrets.”</p>

<p>“I won’t tell any more. ’Deed and ’deed I
won’t,” said Adele, lifting a tear-stained face.
“Please love me best, Jessie.” She caught Jessie’s
hands and put them around her own neck
looking at her so pleadingly that Jessie’s heart
melted and she answered; “All right, I’ll like
you best.”</p>

<p>But the words were scarcely out of her mouth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
before they were stopped with kisses, and Adele
looked as happy as she had looked miserable a
moment before. “Now come,” she said, “let’s
go to the grotto. I brought paper dolls; one is
Wendy and the other is Tinker Bell. Now you
can finish the story, and we’ll have a lovely time.”</p>

<p>They started off very happily, Mrs. Loomis
watching them from the window. “I don’t know
how it is going to turn out,” she said to herself,
“but I hope Jessie will learn self-control by seeing
how it looks to fly into such tantrums as
Adele’s. I think the sight of them will do her
more good than any amount of precept.”</p>

<p>Having given her word that Polly should no
more have first place, Jessie was ready to be very
amiably disposed toward Adele, yet from nine
o’clock in the morning till six in the evening is a
long stretch, and it was rather too much to expect
that two excitable little girls could spend all
that time in one another’s company without disagreements.
Once during the day Jessie gathered
up her dolls and started for home, leaving Adele
disconsolately sitting on a stone, but Adele was
the first to ask to make up, and begged so hard
to be taken back into favor that Jessie yielded.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
Once, too, Adele in a sudden rage threatened to
demolish the grotto, because Jessie insisted upon
having her way with Wendy.</p>

<p>“She’s mine,” protested Adele.</p>

<p>“I don’t care. I know all about her better
than you. I saw the play and you didn’t,” this
conclusively.</p>

<p>Adele flung Wendy on the ground and added
insult to injury by threatening to chop down Playmate
Polly some night. “And when you get up
in the morning, she will be gone forever,” said
Adele.</p>

<p>This was too much for Jessie. “You won’t
dare to do such a thing,” she cried. “I shall tell
my father never to let you step your foot on the
place again. You can just take your old paper
dolls and go home.”</p>

<p>Adele arose speechless with rage. She deliberately
tore Tinker Bell into bits and threw the
pieces at Jessie, then snatching up Wendy she
turned toward home.</p>

<p>At once Jessie seemed to hear her mother say:
“We must be patient with her; she has no
mother.” And she was filled with remorse.
“Come back, come back,” she cried. “I didn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
mean it at all. You can have Wendy do anything
you like. And it doesn’t matter about
Tinker Bell. No one ever sees her anyway, for
she’s just a little twinkling light. One of the
candles will do for her. I’m sorry; I really am,
Adele.” So peace was made, and the rest of the
day passed happily enough.</p>

<p>When they went up to the house for dinner
Sam met them. “I’ve got a new pet for you,”
he said to Jessie. “Come down to the barn
after dinner and I’ll show you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, what is it? Do tell us,” begged Jessie.</p>

<p>But Sam laughed and walked away, so Jessie
knew it was no use to question further, for Sam
never would be coaxed to tell. She was in great
haste to finish her dinner, but Adele was hungry
and seemed to enjoy everything so much that
Jessie felt that it would not be polite to hurry
her. She did not hesitate, however, to urge
Adele to make haste as soon as her last mouthful
of dessert was swallowed. “Do come right
away,” she said. “I must see what Sam has.
Aren’t you wild to know? I am.”</p>

<p>“What do you think it is?” said Adele.
“Maybe he was only fooling.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>“No, I am sure he was in earnest. I know
Sam well enough for that. He often brings me
things, and I have an idea this is something
alive.”</p>

<p>The two children were not long in reaching
the barn, the big door of which was open. It
was a big, roomy place smelling of hay. Three
horses stood in their stalls, and as the little girls
entered, a brown hen flew cackling from one of
the empty mangers. “I’ll have Sam get that
egg for us,” remarked Jessie. “I wonder where
he is. Sam! Sam!” she called.</p>

<p>A voice answered from the harness room and
Jessie led the way thither. Sam was sitting on
a box mending harness. “Here we are,” said
Jessie. “Show us what you said you had.”</p>

<p>“See if you can find it,” said Sam, and Jessie
immediately set to work to search. She knew
all the corners and crannies, if Adele did not.
It was quite like a game, and rather an entertaining
one. Here they came upon a setting hen
who had stolen a nest in the hay; there a squeaking
mouse would scuttle across the timbers, scaring
both girls into shrieking. At last they made
their discovery, for, as they were searching in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
front of Barney’s stall, directly above their heads
something suddenly cried out: “Caw!”</p>

<p>The children looked up to see a black crow
looking down at them from a perch in the corner.
“Oh, I believe that is it,” said Jessie. “Sam!
Sam! is it a crow?”</p>

<p>Sam came forward and lifted down the bird
which was tethered by a long cord. “Yes,” he
said. “He is a young one that got a little hurt
somehow. I found him in the cornfield. He’ll
learn to talk after a bit, and I’ve clipped his
wings so he can’t fly far. He will get as tame
as a dog after a while.”</p>

<p>Jessie put a finger on the shining black head
of the crow. “Isn’t he funny?” she said. “It
will be perfectly lovely to have a pet who can
talk, and I think you are very good, Sam, to bring
him to me. Will he say real words, like people?”</p>

<p>“He won’t be quite as glib as a parrot, maybe,
but he will say a number of words, and it won’t
be long before he will be following you everywhere.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think he is very pretty,” remarked
Adele, who was standing at one side and did not
seem to care about touching the bird.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>“Oh, I think he is,” returned Jessie. “He is
so jetty black, and has such a knowing look. I
like him very much. I don’t suppose I can keep
him in the house, Sam.”</p>

<p>“Better not, or he’ll be playing havoc with
things. He’ll soon learn to stay around with the
chickens, and when you want to have him near
you can tether him. I knew one once that was
as good as a watch-dog. Let any one come
around day or night and he’d set up his Caw!
Caw! I’ll take him out-of-doors for you now.
He can’t get away very far, but I’d better tether
him. Where’ll you have him?”</p>

<p>“Oh, down by the brook where we play,”
Jessie told him.</p>

<p>The two little girls led the way and Sam tethered
the bird by a long cord. He hopped around
contentedly, and soon became tame enough to
come quite close to the girls and peck at their
feet. “Polly can take care of him, you see,”
said Jessie. “I think she rather likes birds, at
least I’ve seen her holding them quite often.”</p>

<p>Adele laughed. “You do say such ridiculous
things about Polly.”</p>

<p>Jessie paid no attention to this remark but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
continued her line of thought. “I think she
misses my playing with her as much as I used to,
so I’ll tell her she can play with the crow all she
likes. I wonder what we’d better call him.
He’s as shiny and black as coal; you know the
kind that has all sorts of colors in it. He looks
that way when he turns his head.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think Coal would be a very pretty
name,” objected Adele.</p>

<p>“I don’t think so either,” Jessie agreed with her.
“I’ll have to think of something else.” They
turned over in their minds all the things that
suggested blackness or darkness, from ink to
thunder-clouds, finally hitting upon Ebony,
which was a happy thought of Jessie’s who remembered
an ebony chest in her Aunt Lucy’s
house. “We can call him Ebon for short,” she
said. “It is a nice, easy name.”</p>

<p>“And Eb would be still shorter,” said Adele.
“Hello, Eb.”</p>

<p>The crow responded by putting his head to
one side and remarking “Caw!” in a way which
made both girls laugh.</p>

<p>“When I get the gray kitten,” said Jessie, “I
shall have two new pets.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>“And I haven’t any,” said Adele wistfully.</p>

<p>“I am sure Effie Hinsdale would give you one
of the kittens,” said Jessie. “I’ll ask mother if
we can go there Saturday. I know she will be
glad—Effie I mean—to get a good home for another
kitten. There is a gray something like
mine and two black ones.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather have black, I think, and I’ll call it
Velvet,” said Adele swift in decision.</p>

<p>“I’ve named mine Cloudy,” Jessie told her.
“We can’t have them yet, you know.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“They’re not big enough to leave their mother.
I thought I saw a cat, a yellow cat, on your
porch one morning.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s the stable cat. He is very wild
and won’t let me come near him. I’d rather
have a kitten anyway.”</p>

<p>“Well, we can go see the kittens at Effie’s
even if we can’t take them just yet, and we shall
have the crow.”</p>

<p>“And Polly,” put in Adele with a laugh.</p>

<p>“She isn’t a pet; she is a friend,” replied Jessie
with some dignity, feeling that Adele meant
to underrate Playmate Polly’s importance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>In a very short time Ebon had become quite
tame, and followed the little girls as if he were
a dog. He constantly amused them by his
funny ways. Although he had not yet learned
to talk, Sam declared that he would in time,
and meanwhile Adele went with Jessie to see
Effie’s kittens, and was promised a black one.
So from having no companions at all, Jessie felt
that she would be very well supplied that winter.
“There will be you and your kitten, me
and my kitten, Polly and Eb,” she said to Adele.
“That will be a great many of us to play together.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and there will be Miss Eloise and horrid
lessons,” returned Adele.</p>

<p>Jessie sighed. “Yes,” she said, “I have been
thinking of that. I wish we could take lessons
like pills and have done with them.”</p>

<p>“In jelly?”</p>

<p>“No, I’d just gulp them down with water and
have some bread and jelly afterward.”</p>

<p>The children were in the sitting-room, having
just returned from Effie’s. Mrs. Loomis was
sitting there sewing. She smiled as she listened
to what the children were saying. “I think you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
will be doing just about as you say,” she remarked.
“You will swallow down your lessons
in the morning, and in the afternoon you will
have your bread and jelly in the shape of play.
I don’t believe you will find the lessons such a
terrible dose as you think.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, I hope so,” returned Jessie with a
sigh. “Come on, Adele; Peter Pan has lost his
shadow again and I must find it.” This Peter
Pan of Jessie’s lost his shadow much more frequently
than did the original one, for the shadow
was nothing but a bit of newspaper fastened by
a piece of thread and it was torn off very often.</p>

<p>“I’m going to have a Peter Pan, too,” Adele
announced triumphantly. “Aunt Betty has
written papa to bring me one the next time he
comes.”</p>

<p>“There couldn’t be two Peter Pans,” said
Jessie in an annoyed tone.</p>

<p>“There could, too. I am sure I have just as
much right to name my doll after the Peter Pan
as you have. There are hundreds and hundreds
of George Washingtons in the world and lots and
lots of Grover Clevelands.”</p>

<p>Jessie could not deny this, but she was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
pleased with the idea of there being another
Peter Pan so close at hand. “If you name
your doll Peter Pan, I’ll call mine something
else,” she said, and then she added, “I won’t
have any use for the grotto, of course, so I will
just pull it down.”</p>

<p>“I think you are horrid mean,” said Adele.
“You know I do love that grotto.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can make one for yourself,” said
Jessie calmly. “There’s just as much stuff
for it on your side of the brook as there is on
mine.”</p>

<p>The tears rushed to Adele’s eyes. “You
know I couldn’t. I should never know how,
and besides your side of the brook has a much
better bank.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Jessie, unmoved, “there simply
cannot be two Peter Pans.”</p>

<p>Adele snatched up her hat and ran from the
room. Jessie, watching her from the window
rather shamefacedly, saw her hurrying down
the hill. She waited till Adele had safely
crossed the log, then she turned away saying
to herself, “There couldn’t possibly be two
Peter Pans.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Like</span> most of their quarrels this between the
two little girls did not last long, for the next
morning Jessie had scarcely finished breakfast
before Adele appeared eager and smiling.
“Papa came last night,” she said, “and so did
Miss Eloise.”</p>

<p>“Then are we to begin taking our pills to-day?”
asked Jessie.</p>

<p>Adele laughed. “No, not till to-morrow.
Aunt Betty and Miss Eloise want to talk, and
besides Aunt Betty says Miss Eloise is tired and
she mustn’t begin to work right away.”</p>

<p>“I thought we were the ones who had to
work,” remarked Jessie.</p>

<p>“Don’t you suppose it is going to be just as
hard for Miss Eloise?” put in Mrs. Loomis.
“Do you imagine it is going to be very amusing
to be shut up with two wilful little girls who
don’t like lessons?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>“Oh!” Jessie had never thought of this side
of the question. She looked at Adele.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Adele. Then after a pause,
“But she doesn’t have to do it if she doesn’t
want to, and we do have to.”</p>

<p>“Do you think all persons who do their
duty in this world really prefer not to do some
other thing?” asked Mr. Loomis. “Some persons
like to teach, I admit, but there are many
who have to learn to like teaching just as much
as you will have to learn to like studying. So
don’t imagine it will be all fun for Miss Laurent.
From what I can learn Miss Eloise consented to
be your teacher because she is a loyal friend, and
as your Aunt Betty, Adele, dreaded the thought
of having a stranger in the house, Miss Eloise
consented to come. She fortunately has a gift
for teaching, but she is willing to come to this
little country village because she can be of use
to Miss Hallett, and because she thinks she can
help you little girls. I hope both of you will remember
that, and that you will do nothing to
make her sorry that she decided to come.”</p>

<p>This very serious way of taking it made the
two little girls feel quite subdued. Adele was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
first to recover her spirits. “You don’t know
what I’ve got,” she sang out as she held something
in her hand behind her.</p>

<p>“Let me see,” cried Jessie springing toward
her. Adele backed away.</p>

<p>“Guess,” she said.</p>

<p>Jessie shook her head. “Can’t.”</p>

<p>“Something papa brought me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know; a doll.”</p>

<p>Adele displayed her new possession. “Yes,
but I am not going to call it Peter Pan, at least,
not yet a while, for it is smaller than yours. I
don’t say I never will, but now I am going to
name it after papa.”</p>

<p>“What is his name?” asked Jessie.</p>

<p>“James. I shall call my doll Jamie. Come
on, let’s go down to the grotto. I wish now I
hadn’t asked for a boy-doll; if it had been a girl
one I could have called it Wendy instead of the
paper one. Do you know, Jessie, Miss Eloise
says that Peter Pan’s house was in the tree tops.”</p>

<p>“So it was,” Jessie remembered.</p>

<p>“But I like the grotto better,” declared Adele.
“Aren’t you ready to go?”</p>

<p>“We can’t go yet; the grass is too wet. We’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
have to wait till the sun dries it a little. We
can play in here for a while.”</p>

<p>Jessie had not been very enthusiastic over the
new doll though she was relieved that it was not
exactly like her own, and that Adele had decided
to call it Jamie. The doll wore a scarlet
coat with tiny brass buttons upon it, white
trousers and a little red cap. He was quite a
pretty little fellow, and Jessie admired him,
though she did not say so. When the sun had
dried the grass enough the children set forth,
Ebon hopping behind them, sometimes taking a
short flight with flapping wings. It was a bright
autumn morning, the sky very blue and the air
pleasant.</p>

<p>“I’m so glad it isn’t raining,” remarked Adele,
“for it is our last morning.”</p>

<p>“Except Saturday. We shall not study on
Saturdays, shall we?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, of course not.”</p>

<p>They had reached the foot of the hill, and
Adele made straight for the grotto, but Jessie
stopped in front of the little Polly Willow.
“Good-morning, Polly,” she said, gently patting
the rough bark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>Adele watched her, and then said mockingly,
“Good-morning, old Polly.” Then she exclaimed,
“I know what I’m going to do; I’m
going to have a house for my Peter Pan, and I
am going to build it on Polly’s head.”</p>

<p>“Indeed you shall not,” replied Jessie. “She
is mine and I shall not let you. Besides you
said you weren’t going to call your doll Peter
Pan.”</p>

<p>“I said I wasn’t at first.”</p>

<p>“This is at first.”</p>

<p>“No, it was at first when I said that; now it
is after a while.”</p>

<p>Jessie turned her back on Adele and it seemed
as if their last evening’s quarrel would break out
afresh.</p>

<p>“Are you mad, Jessie?” questioned Adele.</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>“Are you, Jessie?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am.” The reply came in offended
tones. “You know I don’t like you to make fun
of Polly.”</p>

<p>“Then say you like me best.”</p>

<p>“I have said that.”</p>

<p>“But do you really mean it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>“Ye-es,” rather reluctantly. “At least I do
when you don’t do me so mean.”</p>

<p>“I won’t have the house on Polly’s head then.
I’ll take this high bush.” She set the scarlet-coated
little figure in a bush close by. “He
looks like some red flower there, doesn’t he? I’m
going to get something to build the house with.”</p>

<p>“What kind of things?”</p>

<p>“Oh, leaves and moss and things.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll stay here and get the grotto in
order,” Jessie decided.</p>

<p>“I’m going to make a cradle for Peter Pan,”
said Adele as she moved off.</p>

<p>Jessie did not follow, but busied herself in
sweeping up, with a bunch of twigs, the bits of
earth which had fallen down over night upon
the floor of the cave, and in putting the moss
into place. Ebon, hopping about, regarded her
with his bright eyes, and coming nearer tried to
peck at the shining piece of glass which made the
lake in the centre of the grotto. “Go away,
Eb,” cried Jessie. “You are getting too fusty
entirely.” She shoved him away with her elbow,
and he strutted off dipping his head and uttering
some protesting caws. After a few minutes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
Jessie had the grotto in pretty good order, but
concluded a few more pebbles would not come
amiss. These must be found in the brook. The
water was very clear, and in the shallow parts
one could easily get at the pebbles lying at the
bottom of the stream. There was a scraggy tree
trunk at the water’s edge, and on this Jessie sat,
holding on to one gnarly root while she reached
over to get the pebbles. Brown leaves went
drifting by on the stream; a Bob White called
from the grass near by. Jessie nodded understandingly
to Playmate Polly. “You like it,
don’t you, Polly, or you wouldn’t stay here. The
idea of any one’s building a house on your head.
I shall put your hat on and then you will be able
to show that you are not just an ordinary tree.
But now I must take back my pebbles.”</p>

<p>She gathered up the little stones and returned
to the grotto where she went on with her paving
till she heard Adele’s voice saying: “I have
some beauty leaves all red and yellow, and I
found some moss, too.” Then an exclamation:
“Why, where is my Peter Pan? Jessie Loomis,
you have hidden him just to tease me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>“’Deed I have not,” returned Jessie. “I have
been getting pebbles from the brook.”</p>

<p>“I put him right here on top of this bush,”
said Adele, “and he’s gone, so you must have
taken him. You did it on purpose just because
you didn’t want me to have a Peter Pan.”</p>

<p>“I did not,” returned Jessie indignantly.
“He could easily have fallen off. Look all
around, in the grass and the leaves.”</p>

<p>“Has Mrs. Mooky been here?” asked Adele.
“You know that story of the little Tom Thumb
that the cow was going to eat.”</p>

<p>“I believe Mrs. Mooky was somewhere about,”
Jessie told her. “No,” she remembered, “it
wasn’t near here that I saw her; it was on the
other side of the fence in the pasture.”</p>

<p>Adele began to hunt around diligently, Jessie
joining in the search, but no lost doll was to be
found. Once a bunch of scarlet berries on a
bush deceived them into thinking that by some
mysterious means the doll had been spirited
away. “For you know he could fly,” said Adele.</p>

<p>At last they were obliged to give up looking,
and Adele went home quite convinced that Jessie
knew where the doll was hidden, and Jessie, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
her turn went off up the hill toward the house,
hurt and distressed to think that Adele should
not have believed her.</p>

<p>She went back after dinner to renew the
search, and became satisfied after a long hunt
that Adele had mistaken the bush and that she
had put it somewhere else. A hollow stump in
the neighborhood seemed the most likely place,
but though she managed to climb up where
she could peep into the hollow, it was all dark
within and a stick poked in did nothing more
than scare a chipmunk nearly out of his wits,
so that presently he came out chattering and
bristling with rage and fear. Jessie went home
and told her mother all about it, and after Mrs.
Loomis had gone with her to see what she could
do, they both concluded that the doll must have
fallen far down into this same hollow stump,
and that it could not be found unless the stump
were grubbed up.</p>

<p>“Do you think I ought to give her my Peter
Pan?” Jessie asked hesitatingly. “I like him
best of all my dolls except Charity.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think you need do that,” her
mother told her, “but when I go to town I will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
try to find one that you can give her to replace
this.”</p>

<p>“May I tell her so?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if you like. I think if you do, it will
convince her that you spoke the truth.”</p>

<p>“She ought to have believed me anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Circumstances were against you, my dear.
I know it is very hard to be suspected, but there
was some reason for Adele’s doing so, and I am
sure she will be satisfied when you tell her she
is to have another doll.”</p>

<p>“May I go over now and tell her?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if you won’t stay too long.”</p>

<p>Jessie set off toward the brook. She did not
fail to search for the doll as she went, but she
stopped to lay her hand upon Playmate Polly
and to say: “You would have believed me,
Polly. You always do believe me, and I don’t
think I shall ever tell Adele again that I like
her best.”</p>

<p>Playmate Polly made no answer, but the
murmuring brook sang a little song that Jessie
liked and the whispering trees seemed to say:
“We know, we know.” The same little chipmunk
was sitting on his haunches on top of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
hollow stump. He chattered fiercely as he saw
Jessie, and leaping into the nearest pine tree
went whisking off. Jessie was not sure but she
liked her favorite playground better without the
presence of Adele, and she almost wished the
yellow house were still empty. It seemed as if
she and Adele were continually at odds, and
though Adele professed to care very much for
her, she didn’t see how it were possible when
she doubted her word.</p>

<p>She went rather slowly through the piece of
woods and through the orchard which lay on the
other side of the brook. She realized that now
she would meet Miss Eloise, and though she
wanted much to see what manner of person she
was, she rather dreaded the meeting, and besides
she really did not feel in a very friendly
mood toward Adele just then, only she could not
have her go on believing untrue things. At
last she came out close to the garden fence.
She stood still for a moment before she opened
the gate and went through. There was no one
about, but she heard voices from the front
porch, and as she turned the corner of the
house she saw that there were four persons on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
the porch, Miss Betty, a strange lady with fair
hair who must be Miss Eloise, a man who was
probably Adele’s father, and Adele herself.
Jessie paused where she stood but Adele had
heard the click of the gate and had caught sight
of the visitor.</p>

<p>“There she is now,” cried Adele. “Have you
found him, Jessie? Have you found him?”</p>

<p>Jessie came slowly forward. “No,” she
said shyly. “Mother helped me to look. We
think he must have fallen down into a hollow
stump and has gone way down inside, but mother
says she is going to town very soon and she will
get you another doll just like it.”</p>

<p>Miss Betty was listening. “Indeed she must
not do that, Jessie,” she said. “A little cheap
doll like that is no loss, besides it was not you
who lost it, but Adele, and her father can
easily get another when he goes back to the
city.”</p>

<p>“But,” Jessie hesitated, then she turned to Miss
Betty. “I want mother to get it so Adele will
believe I spoke the truth, that I don’t tell stories.”
Jessie held her head high.</p>

<p>Miss Betty looked at Adele. “Why, honey,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
she said, “I am sure you never told Jessie that
she wasn’t truthful.”</p>

<p>Adele nodded. “Hm, hm, I did, because I
thought she might have hidden the doll to tease
me and because she didn’t want me to have a
Peter Pan.”</p>

<p>“But she has proved that she does want you
to have one by asking her mother to replace the
one that is lost, and besides, you told me that you
were the last one that had the doll.”</p>

<p>Adele rushed at Jessie and flung her arms
around her. “Wasn’t I horrid?” she said. “I’ll
believe every word you say after this. I suppose
you will say,” she whispered, “that Polly always
has believed you.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Jessie nodded, “she certainly does.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care,” returned Adele defiantly. “I
believe after all that she is a thief, and that she
stole my doll.”</p>

<p>“What are you talking about?” asked Miss
Betty. “You both look as fierce as turkey-cocks.”</p>

<p>“I’m talking about that old Polly,” answered
Adele.</p>

<p>“You absurd children!” said Miss Betty laughing.
“Come, Jessie, don’t you want to meet your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
teacher? She is very anxious to meet you.
Eloise, dear, this is your other little pupil.”</p>

<p>Jessie was conscious of a pair of gray eyes that
looked at her very steadily but very kindly, and
of two warm hands that held hers, but she was
overcome with shyness and said not a word.</p>

<p>“Do you think you are going to like her more
than you do me?” Adele asked Miss Eloise anxiously.</p>

<p>“You jealous little monkey,” said her aunt.
“Why shouldn’t she like Jessie best? Don’t you
want her to?”</p>

<p>“I want her to like us both alike,” replied
Adele.</p>

<p>“A perfectly safe reply,” said Miss Eloise. “I
hope I have a place in my heart big enough for
both of you, my dears.”</p>

<p>“This is papa,” said Adele swinging Jessie
around in front of Mr. Hallett, who held out his
hand.</p>

<p>“I hope you and this will-o’-the-wisp of ours
will be good friends,” he said to Jessie. “She
needs some one to tone her down a little, and
keep her from having tantrums.” He softly patted
Adele’s hand as he spoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>“Jessie has tantrums, too,” spoke up Adele,
“but they are pouty ones, not screamy like mine.”</p>

<p>Jessie blushed and felt greatly embarrassed.
She wished Adele were not quite so outspoken.</p>

<p>“Never mind, dear,” said Miss Eloise leaning
over and putting her arm around Jessie. “If we
don’t all have tantrums we all feel like it sometimes,
and when we were little girls very few of
us did not have them. We generally outgrew
them, or learned self-control, and that is what
you and Adele will do.”</p>

<p>Jessie looked up gratefully and from that moment
liked Miss Eloise.</p>

<p>So soon did this lady put her at her ease that
in a few minutes she found herself talking quite
glibly about her home, her pets, and her reasons
for leaving school, realizing that she would not
in the least mind having lessons the next day.
But presently she remembered that she was not
to stay too long, so she took her leave, Adele
calling after her: “Remember, you are not to
get another doll. I won’t let you, and I’d rather
have a Wendy anyhow.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was with rather mixed feelings that Jessie
set out the next morning to begin lessons with
Miss Eloise. She didn’t enjoy the idea of studying,
but she did like Miss Eloise and it would be
quite a novelty to have but one other schoolmate.
She felt rather important, too, from the fact that
she was to begin French and music. This last
thought gave confidence to her step and brightness
to her face when she appeared on the porch
of the yellow house.</p>

<p>Adele danced out to meet her. “We’re all
ready,” she said. “Miss Eloise and I have been
fixing up the schoolroom, and we have put flowers
in there so it looks very nice. We are to
have a table between us, you and I. You shall
choose which end you like best and I will take
the other. Elle est ici, mademoiselle,” she called
out when they reached the top of the stairs, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
Jessie suddenly remembered that Adele knew
French almost as well as English, and she felt
herself very ignorant.</p>

<p>However, Miss Eloise gave her such a cordial
greeting, and the schoolroom was so bright and
cheery that she soon forgot everything but her
interest in choosing which end of the table she
preferred, and in looking at the books Miss
Eloise had piled up. They were all fresh and
new and Jessie liked new books. “I don’t know
a word of French,” she said when she had
seated herself.</p>

<p>“You need not say that very long,” said Miss
Eloise.</p>

<p>“She need not say it five minutes from now,”
put in Adele. “She can begin with <i>Bon jour</i>,
can’t she, Miss Eloise? Say <i>Bon jour</i>, Jessie.”</p>

<p>Jessie obediently repeated the words.</p>

<p>“Now you can say good-day,” Adele told her,
“and you can’t say any more that you don’t
know a word of French.” Then she turned to
Miss Eloise and chatted away volubly for a
minute or two while Jessie listened and wondered
if she would ever be so glib with a foreign
tongue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>“I think I will make a rule that you are to
speak to each other only in French during lesson
hours,” said Miss Eloise. “That will give you
both a chance and Jessie will be surprised how
soon she will be able to understand and speak a
number of words. Now we will start in with
something else. Come here, Jessie, and show me
how far you have gone in arithmetic and how
well you can spell.”</p>

<p>It turned out that Jessie was far ahead of
Adele in these studies, but that the latter knew
more history and had a smattering of a number
of other things which Jessie knew nothing about.
But after a while Miss Eloise managed to arrange
classes for them, dropping some of Adele’s
studies, which did not seem necessary for the
present, and adding some to Jessie’s list. But
they had hardly settled down to real work before
it was time for a morsel of lunch and a fifteen
minutes’ run out-of-doors.</p>

<p>“I don’t think those were very bad pills to
take,” said Jessie as the two sat munching their
apples on the porch steps.</p>

<p>“They will be worse after a while, I suppose,”
said Adele. “Wait till you have to sit at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
piano and practice stupid exercises half an hour
at a time. You won’t like that one bit.”</p>

<p>“I suppose not,” returned Jessie with a
sigh. “But you don’t have to do that all the
time, do you? You will have pieces after a
while.”</p>

<p>“Oh, after a fashion, but they are not what I
call tunes,” she said scornfully.</p>

<p>This sounded very discouraging, but Jessie
was not going to give up hope. “Maybe some
teachers do that way,” she said, “but I don’t believe
Miss Eloise will.”</p>

<p>“Wait and see,” returned Adele with a wise
shake of the head.</p>

<p>The tinkle of a little bell took them indoors to
lessons again, and the next hour or two passed
quickly, and to Jessie’s surprise very pleasantly.
“It is much nicer than going to the Hill School,”
she told her mother. “I know a whole lot of
French and some of my notes on the piano.
When I know them all am I going to have a
piano, mother?”</p>

<p>“Not at present,” Mrs. Loomis told her. “You
are to practice on Adele’s piano for a while.
Pianos are rather expensive things and we shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
have to save up a lot of eggs and butter before
we can buy one.”</p>

<p>“Adele is richer than I am, isn’t she, mother?”</p>

<p>“In some things, perhaps, but she has no
mother nor brothers.”</p>

<p>Jessie threw her arms around her mother’s
neck and gave her a mighty hug. “And you
are worth all the money in the world,” she said.
“My two brothers are pretty far away, but I do
see them sometimes, and that’s much better than
not having any at all. Yes, I believe I am much
richer than Adele. She hasn’t any pets either.
Where is Eb, mother?”</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear, I don’t know. He is out-of-doors
somewhere. We cannot have him in the
house very often, for he gets into so much mischief.”</p>

<p>Jessie went out to find Eb, but not seeing him
near, she concluded to go to Playmate Polly and
tell her all about her morning at the yellow
house, for Polly was always a good listener. It
was rather pleasant, too, to feel free to do exactly
as she liked after the restriction of a morning in
the schoolroom.</p>

<p>She was sitting on a big rock talking quietly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
in an undertone to Polly, when with a whoop and
a hallo two boys came vaulting over the fence
and rushed toward her. For a moment Jessie
was so startled that she could give only little
shrieks, but these soon changed to a squeal of
delight when she discovered the two intruders
to be her brothers, Max and Walter. “Oh!
oh!” she cried. “Where did you come from,
and how do you happen to be home to-day?”</p>

<p>“Why, it is just a piece of luck for us,” said
Max catching her up and kissing her. “One of
the boys, Carl Potter, is ill with something, the
doctor doesn’t know just what yet, and so he
thought we boys had better come home for a
few days till he finds out whether it is diphtheria
or not. Of course I don’t mean it is luck
for old Carl, but it gives us a holiday.”</p>

<p>“I hope it isn’t diphtheria,” said Jessie sympathetically,
“though it is nice to have you home;
it does seem so quiet without you. I have a
thousand things to tell you.”</p>

<p>“Fire away,” said Max.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t go to the Hill School any more,
but I have lessons with Adele—she lives in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
yellow house, you know. I know some French.
<i>Bon jour, monsieur. Comme portez vous?</i>”</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” interrupted Walter. “I can beat
that with Latin.”</p>

<p>“Let’s hear you,” said Jessie.</p>

<p>“Stop your fooling,” put in Max. “Don’t be
such a blower, Walter. I know just about how
much Latin you know. Never mind him, Jess,
go on.”</p>

<p>“I have begun music, too,” Jessie turned to her
elder brother, “and some day I shall have a piano
when mother can save enough butter and eggs to
get me one.”</p>

<p>“That will be fine,” said Max encouragingly.</p>

<p>“Then you don’t see old Ezra any more,” said
Walter, “and can’t tell us anything about the
trains and the engines.”</p>

<p>“No.” Jessie shook her head. “I haven’t
been to see him. He had rheumatism, and I
fell on the track one day; that’s why I stopped
going to school. There is a cross man in Ezra’s
place and I don’t like him.”</p>

<p>“I say, that’s too bad,” said Max. “Old Ezra
is always so good-natured about letting you flag
trains and things.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>“I’ve got a crow,” suddenly exclaimed Jessie,
“and his name is Eb. That’s short for Ebony.
He doesn’t talk yet, but he is going to, Sam says.
I think he must be up in the barn. Come, and
I’ll show him to you. I have a new friend, too.
Her name is Adele Pauline Falaise Hallett, and
she lives in the yellow house.”</p>

<p>“Mother wrote to us that the yellow house
was taken,” said Walter. “I’m sorry, for now
we fellows can’t go there and play in that empty
barn like we used to.”</p>

<p>“I thought Effie Hinsdale was your best
friend,” said Max to his sister.</p>

<p>“Effie is a friend, of course, but she lives across
the railroad, and I can’t go to see her unless
some one goes with me. Besides, she has a new
friend, too; a girl named Anna Sharp that has
come to the neighborhood, so Effie don’t mind
being second best. She has a gray kitten that is
to be mine when it is big enough.”</p>

<p>“Girls are always so crazy about cats and
kittens,” said Walter scornfully. “I’d much
rather have the crow.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can’t have him. Sam brought him
to me,” returned Jessie a little sharply. Boys<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
were entirely too fond of making slighting remarks
about girls, she thought.</p>

<p>“Oh, keep your old crow,” returned Walter.
“No doubt you’ll be glad enough to get rid of
him some day.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Jessie.</p>

<p>“Wait and see,” replied Walter mysteriously.
“Say, Max, let’s go see old Ezra. Maybe he is
all right now, and I want to know about the
trains. We’ll see enough of the old crow, and
it is a good time to go to Ezra’s.”</p>

<p>“I want to go, too,” said Jessie.</p>

<p>“Well, you can’t,” returned Walter. “We
don’t want girls tagging everywhere we go.”</p>

<p>“Oh, let her come,” put in Max. “You might
be a little more decent to her the first day you
get home. You can come, Jess.” Max was the
eldest and Walter generally accepted his lead,
so Jessie put her hand confidingly in her big
brother’s and they set out. She thought Walter
was very disagreeable to speak to her as he did
when he had been separated from her all these
weeks, and she took pains not to address a word
to him on the way. She chatted to Max, however
talking of the things she knew would interest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
him: the change in the schedule, how 589
was very late one day, and how she had flagged
a train one afternoon, how 248 had a hot box
one morning so it had to stop on a siding. When
Walter put eager questions to her she simply
gave him a dignified stare and went on talking
to Max. Her triumph was complete when they
arrived at the crossing to find that Ezra was
back again at his post and that his best greeting
was for the little girl.</p>

<p>“Well, well, well,” he exclaimed, “here you
are at last. I certainly have missed you, little
girl. Not going to school any more? I was
afraid you might be sick. Been watching for
ye every day since I got over my rheumatiz.
When you going to start again? Hallo, boys.”
He gave a nod to each, but it was plain to see
that it was Jessie who had the warmest welcome.</p>

<p>“I’ve stopped going to school,” Jessie told
him. “You weren’t here, you know, Ezra, so
father and mother were afraid to have me cross
the track. I tripped and fell one day when the
train was coming.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” exclaimed Ezra. “Sykes never
told me of that. I was in such misery I couldn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
think about much else but my pains for a while.
You don’t say you ain’t going back at all?”</p>

<p>“Not this winter,” Jessie told him. “I am
studying with Adele Hallett at the yellow
house.”</p>

<p>“They’re new folks, ain’t they? Well, I certainly
am sorry to lose the sight of ye every day.
It is too bad Sykes had to take my place or ye
might be mounting the hill every morning just
the same as usual. Father knew I’d look out for
ye, didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. He said as long as you were there
he didn’t have any fear, even if the trains were
changed. But after I fell that day when the
train was coming, mother said she would never
feel easy again.”</p>

<p>“Too bad, too bad. I am sorry.” Ezra took
off his cap and wiped his bald head with a red
handkerchief. He was a little wrinkled-faced
old man with mild blue eyes. He wore a little
fringe of beard under his chin, and his pleasant
mouth always widened to a smile for his friends.
“Right warm day for October, ain’t it?” he said
pulling up his stool which stood by the door of
the little house. “Wish I had more chairs to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
offer ye. Guess ladies will have to come first.”
He waved Jessie to the stool.</p>

<p>“Oh, no.” Jessie refused the proffered seat.
“We’d rather you’d sit there, Ezra. The boys
and I can do just as well with these railroad ties
that are piled up here. Has 589 gone by yet?”</p>

<p>Ezra took out his watch. “She’s due in just
five minutes. I thought I heard her whistling
for Boyds a while ago. She’s on time to-day.”</p>

<p>“May I hold the flag?” said Jessie eagerly.
“It has been such a long time since I did.”</p>

<p>“To be sure ye may,” returned Ezra, taking
the flag from where it stood leaning against the
door. “Yes, I thought so; she’s whistling for
the cut.”</p>

<p>So far Jessie had monopolized the conversation
and now Walter spoke up. “Have they put on
any new engines, Ezra?”</p>

<p>He shook his head. “No, Leander still runs
old 61 and keeps her shining.”</p>

<p>“Any accidents?” asked Max.</p>

<p>“Glad to say ther hain’t. Come near being one
down by Millersville the other day.”</p>

<p>“Tell us about it.”</p>

<p>“Have to wait till 589 has went by. Here,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
honey,” he turned to Jessie. “Get up and be all
ready. She’ll whistle in a minute for our
crossing.”</p>

<p>Jessie took her place on the stool set for her,
flag in hand, Ezra standing close by, and presently
there was a shrill whistle and next the
train flew by.</p>

<p>“It is so exciting,” said Jessie turning a beaming
face to her brothers.</p>

<p>“Humph!” exclaimed Walter in rather a dissatisfied
way. He did not like it that Jessie
should be having all the fun. “What about the
accident?” he said turning to Ezra.</p>

<p>“There wasn’t none.”</p>

<p>“Well, I mean the one that nearly was.”</p>

<p>Ezra launched forth into an account of how
the freight train from the west was on the track
and a special was behind her. Somehow Bill
Downs didn’t get the orders clear and backed
into a siding just in time to avoid a crash. “Reversed,
sir,” said Ezra. “Heard the special
whistle at the cut and put on steam so he reached
the siding in time to back. If he’d been a second
later all would have been up.”</p>

<p>The children listened attentively. Bill Downs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
was a familiar figure to them, and his engine an
old acquaintance, so his escape was of momentous
interest.</p>

<p>After a little more railroad gossip the boys
concluded it was time to return, as the sun was
setting and the short afternoon was nearly over.
“Come again, come again,” said Ezra, his eyes
on Jessie who waved her hand to him till a turn
in the road hid him from sight.</p>

<p>“I wish I had taken him some apples,” she
said. “His trees have hardly any on them this
year, and he is so fond of them.”</p>

<p>“We’ll take some to him to-morrow,” said
Walter importantly. “You needn’t bother.”</p>

<p>“I thought of it first,” said Jessie, not liking
to have her ideas taken possession of in this
style.</p>

<p>“That makes no difference,” returned Walter.
“The few you could carry wouldn’t do much
good. Max and I can take a big basketful.”</p>

<p>Jessie did not answer, but she determined to
carry out her plan if she could. If going away
to school made Walter like this she didn’t think
it was doing him much good. The boys left her
at the first gate for they caught sight of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
father in a field near by, and joined him, so Jessie
went up to the house alone. She sought her
mother immediately. “Mother,” she said, “I
wish you would send Walter to another school.”</p>

<p>“Why, my dear,” returned Mrs. Loomis, looking
up with a smile.</p>

<p>“Because he’s so—so—he has such a contemptibleness
for girls since he’s been away. He
used not to care when I wanted to go with him
and Max, and now he is at home again he just
wants to put me down all the time. I said I
wanted to take some apples to Ezra, and he says
he is going to. I thought of it first, mother, and
Ezra has been so good to me. Couldn’t you let
Sam go with me to-morrow morning, and carry
a big basketful, bigger than Walter and Max
could carry?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Loomis was thoughtful for a moment.
She realized that Walter had no right to set aside
Jessie’s little plan, so she said, “I am afraid
Sam cannot be spared, but I will tell you what
can be done. I have to go to Mrs. Traill’s to-morrow
morning, and you could go as far as the
crossing with me. We can carry a big basket of
apples in the phaeton and leave them for Ezra,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
then you can go on to your lessons from
there.”</p>

<p>“Oh, lovely!” cried Jessie. “You always do
think of just the right thing, mother. Will you
tell Walter we are going to take the apples?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I think it is right that you should
be the one to go with them, for we appreciate
very much his kindness to you.”</p>

<p>No more was said then, but at the supper table
Mrs. Loomis told her husband what had been arranged
and asked him to select a lot of their
finest apples for the basket. Jessie gave Walter
a triumphant look across the table. He answered
by making a mouth at her, but she did not care
as she had her mother on her side.</p>

<p>“Sneaky thing,” whispered Walter as she passed
him after supper.</p>

<p>“Sneaky yourself,” returned Jessie. “I told
mother how horrid you were.”</p>

<p>“Tattletale,” returned Walter. “Just like a
girl.”</p>

<p>This time Jessie had no words except the expressive
exclamation “Pff!” given with a most
contemptuous toss of the head.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> rest of the time that the boys were at
home Jessie did not see much of them. She found
so many things to interest her at the yellow
house, that she enjoyed the novelty of it, and
moreover, when she was there she was free from
Walter’s teasing, so she spent most of her time
with Adele, to the latter’s delight.</p>

<p>The afternoon of the day when the apples were
taken to Ezra, the two little girls sought their
playground by the brook, but Max and Walter
discovered them, and as they did not want their
secrets known, they quickly covered up the
grotto and beat a hasty retreat across the brook.
“I don’t mind Max so much,” Jessie explained,
“though even he teases sometimes, but Walter
is such a worry when he sets out to be, and if he
knew about Playmate Polly and Peter Pan’s
grotto he would be sure to do something to them
just to pay me back for taking the apples. So<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
we will play in your garden or the summer-house.
I will take Charity and you can get one of your
dolls.”</p>

<p>“The back porch is a good place,” returned
Adele. “I am sorry your brothers aren’t nice
and I am glad I haven’t any.”</p>

<p>“But they are nice,” returned Jessie on the defensive.
“They are very nice. All boys tease
and Max was lovely the other day when I wanted
to go with them. He is older than Walter. I
suppose that is the reason. Since Walter has
been going to boarding-school he thinks himself
so smart.”</p>

<p>The two little girls trudged up the hill toward
the yellow house and as they entered the garden
they heard some one calling, “Adele! Adele!
where are you?”</p>

<p>“That’s Aunt Betty,” said Adele. “I wonder
what she wants.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go see,” returned Jessie.</p>

<p>They ran around the corner of the house.
Miss Betty and Miss Eloise were both on the
front porch. By the steps was standing a little
gray pony harnessed to a small pony cart. “Oh,
dear, company, I suppose,” said Adele disgustedly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
“I wish we’d stayed away. I suppose now I shall
have to be kissed and called a sweet child.”</p>

<p>“I wonder who it is,” said Jessie more curious.
“That turnout does not belong to any one around
here. I know just what every one drives. Effie
Hinsdale’s mother has a white horse; the minister’s
wife drives a sorrel; Mrs. Traill has two
black horses and——”</p>

<p>But she went no further for Miss Betty had
seen the two children and was calling out, “Come
here, dears, such a lovely surprise for you!
Whose do you think that is, Adele?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know. It isn’t the cousins
from the city, is it, Aunt Bet?” said Adele.</p>

<p>“No.” Miss Betty shook her head. “It belongs
to the cousin of the cousins from the city.”</p>

<p>Adele looked bewildered. “Who is that?”</p>

<p>Miss Betty laughed. “Who is your cousins’
cousin? Don’t you know?”</p>

<p>“Aunt Betty, you don’t mean me!” cried
Adele. “It isn’t mine. It couldn’t possibly be.”</p>

<p>“That is exactly whose it is,” Miss Betty told
her. “Your father has sent it to you for a birthday
gift.”</p>

<p>“But my birthday is past and gone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>“That is true. He couldn’t get what he
wanted at once, so he had to wait, and so your
present has just arrived.”</p>

<p>Adele rushed forward and clasped the pony’s
neck. “Oh, you dear beautiful thing,” she
cried. “I love you. Oh, Jessie, isn’t he a
beauty?”</p>

<p>Jessie could but agree that he certainly was.</p>

<p>“And can I drive him myself?” asked Adele
eagerly.</p>

<p>“When you learn how,” she was told.</p>

<p>“I can drive,” declared Jessie. “I often drive
when I am out with mother.”</p>

<p>“Your father says he is very gentle,” remarked
Miss Eloise to Adele.</p>

<p>“Then couldn’t we try him now?” begged
Adele.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t Jessie drive him just a little way to
see how he goes?”</p>

<p>Miss Betty looked at Miss Eloise. “Do you
think it would be safe?” she said.</p>

<p>“Can you really drive, Jessie?” asked Miss
Eloise.</p>

<p>“I truly can,” Jessie told her. “I often drive
all the way. I can turn out for the big teams<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
and I can drive in through the gates as straight
as anything.”</p>

<p>“Then you may jump in and show us what
you can do,” Miss Betty consented, and the little
girls were not slow in obeying.</p>

<p>“How far may we go?” asked Jessie taking
up the reins.</p>

<p>“Oh, not out of sight. Just up and down the
road where we can see you,” Miss Betty directed.</p>

<p>Jessie proudly turned the pony’s head toward
the gate, drove through without accident, and
soon the little pony was trotting up the road.
Miss Betty and Miss Eloise came to the gate to
watch. Jessie turned carefully and brought the
pony back in triumph.</p>

<p>“Can’t she drive well?” said Adele admiringly.
“She is going to teach me, and when she
isn’t here to do it Otto can.” Otto was the Halletts’
man. “What shall I name him, Aunt
Betty?”</p>

<p>“Why not call him Dapple Gray?” suggested
Miss Eloise.</p>

<p>“Good! That will just suit him, but I shall
never lend him to a lady to ride him far away.
Oh, no, we don’t want to get out yet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>“But the little pony must be tired. He has
come a long distance to-day.”</p>

<p>That put another face upon the matter and
Adele was quite willing that Jessie should give
up the reins to Otto who led Dapple Gray to the
stable.</p>

<p>“I never knew such lovely things as happen
nowadays,” said Adele as she and Jessie returned
to the garden. “First I met you and we had
the lovely plays down by the brook, then came
Eb, and now this dear Dapple Gray! Before I
came here weeks and weeks used to go by and
nothing at all happened. I do hope we can go
driving every day by ourselves; it would be such
fun.”</p>

<p>Within a week Adele had learned to manage
her pony pretty well, and the two little girls
were allowed to take a short drive each day,
not going out of sight of the house, but in time
Adele tired of this and was bent upon going
farther. She begged and entreated till Miss
Betty was on the point of yielding, and at last
agreed to take a longer drive than usual in her
own carriage that Adele and Jessie might follow
in the pony cart. This satisfied Adele for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
week, but there came a day when Miss Betty
had one of her severe headaches, and Miss Eloise
was not willing to leave her, so the two little
girls were told they could take their drive alone,
but must not go out of sight.</p>

<p>They started off contentedly enough, but soon
Adele became tired of the monotonous drive up
and down in front of the house. “Miss Eloise is
with Aunt Betty and I know she isn’t thinking
about us,” she said. “We may just as well go a
little further and she will never know. It is so
silly to go up and down, up and down, this
stupid road and nowhere else.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but it wouldn’t be right, whether she
sees us or not,” protested Jessie.</p>

<p>“There isn’t a bit of harm in it,” Adele insisted.
“We go every day, and just because we
are not with them it doesn’t matter. I am going
further whether any one likes it or not.” She
gave a little jerk to the reins and Dapple Gray
started off on a trot. The excitement of a faster
gait stirred Adele to further desire for a rapid
drive. “I am tired to death of this old road,”
she declared. “I want to go somewhere new.
I am going to turn up this way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>“Oh, no, please don’t,” begged Jessie.</p>

<p>“You needn’t say a word,” Adele interrupted.
“You haven’t a thing to do with it. This is my
pony and my cart, and you have to do it to sit
still. You are my company and I am taking you
to drive.”</p>

<p>Jessie felt that this was quite true, though she
knew that Adele was doing wrong. She realized
that she ought to do something, but she did not
know just what. If she insisted upon getting
out and going home she would leave Adele all
alone, and that would be worse than staying to
help her out of any difficulty into which she
might fall. “Perhaps I’d better drive,” she ventured
after a while when Adele had recklessly
driven over a big stone and had almost bumped
into a stump by the way.</p>

<p>“No, you shall not,” returned Adele. “The
only way to learn to do a thing is to keep on doing
it, no matter if you do it wrong sometimes.
Papa always says so.”</p>

<p>Jessie had nothing to reply to this, but she
watched Adele carefully. They were coming to
a hill. Jessie looked around earnestly. “Oh!”
she exclaimed, “do be careful, Adele. We are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
coming to the cut. It is at the foot of this
hill. We came by the mill, I remember, and this
leads by the old schoolhouse. We’d better turn
and go back.”</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” replied Adele, “I’m going
on. If you are scared you can get out and
walk.”</p>

<p>Jessie’s feelings were deeply hurt. She wasn’t
exactly scared, but she knew at the foot of the
hill was the railroad cut, and though there was
always some one there, if the horse took fright,
or if anything happened to the cart or harness,
it might mean an accident. “We have to cross
the railroad,” she said after a pause.</p>

<p>“Well, suppose we do; other people cross it,”
was the answer.</p>

<p>“Hold him in,” cried Jessie sharply, clutching
at the reins as Dapple Gray went down the hill
at a more rapid rate than she felt safe.</p>

<p>“Just let me alone,” cried Adele giving Dapple
Gray a light touch with the whip.</p>

<p>“Don’t! Don’t!” cried Jessie, but Adele only
laughed, and directly they were at the foot of
the hill where the railroad ran. Instead of taking
a clean straight course across it, Adele tried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
to drive diagonally. “There’s a whistle,” cried
Jessie in alarm. Adele raised the whip again.
Dapple Gray made a plunge forward. A wheel
caught and presently Jessie was conscious that
she was rolling down an embankment. Then she
knew nothing for some time.</p>

<p>When she came to her senses, she was lying in
a little gully among some bushes. She raised
her head and then struggled to her feet. “No
bones broken,” she said to herself, though she
felt shaken and sore. She stood up and looked
around. At a little distance she saw Adele sitting
sobbing miserably. She ran toward her as
fast as her bruises would allow. “Oh, Adele!
Adele!” she cried, “are you hurt?”</p>

<p>“Oh! my arm, my arm,” moaned Adele. “I
believe it is broken.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, dear, how dreadful,” responded
Jessie. “Where is Dapple Gray?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>Jessie climbed the bank and there saw Dapple
Gray patiently standing, a broken wheel showing
what had happened. The wheel had caught in
the track and although both girls were thrown
out as the wheel gave way the little pony had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
not bolted, but stood his ground. Jessie went up
to him, and began to unfasten the harness. “It
won’t do for you to stand so near the track,” she
said. “You were a dear good pony not to run.
The cart isn’t on the track, I am glad to say.”
She led the pony down the bank to where Adele
sat. “We are quite a way from home,” she said.
“Shall you be afraid to stay here while I go for
some one to take us back?”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t leave me, don’t leave me,” Adele
wept.</p>

<p>“If you could come up a little higher, you
could watch me as I go,” said Jessie. “Ezra
lives the nearest, and I am going down the track
to call him.” Adele, still moaning and crying,
allowed herself to be led to a higher spot. “I
don’t think there will be any more trains for
some time,” Jessie assured her, “and if you stay
right here you can watch me going and coming.
I will be as quick as I can.”</p>

<p>Adele suffered herself to be left and Jessie set
out. Further down the railroad spanned a gully
through which ran the brook. The only way to
cross it was upon a narrow boardwalk on one
side the bridge, this being used by the workmen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
as a short cut. The longer way was to go down
hill and around to a foot-bridge higher up the
brook. Jessie hesitated when she reached the
path which led down hill. Should she go that
way, or should she venture across the railroad
bridge? If she did not look down and hold
closely to the railing, perhaps it would not be so
bad. She decided to try. So she stepped cautiously
upon the planks and went on slowly,
doing very well till she reached the middle, when
incautiously she glanced down at the rushing
water below. For one moment she felt sick and
faint. Everything swam around. Then she
closed her eyes and held tightly to the railing,
stepping along slowly, each moment seeming an
hour. In a few minutes her heart stopped its
rapid beating and her head felt steady, so she
opened her eyes and fixed them on the opposite
bank, not once turning them from there, and at
last she was safely over.</p>

<p>A little beyond was Ezra’s house with its smiling
garden and white fence. Although she felt
sore and bruised she began to run, forgetting her
pain in her anxiety to reach the house. It was
about Ezra’s supper time; there would be no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
trains coming or going at this time of day, and
she would be sure to find the old man at home.
So she began to call, “Ezra! Ezra!” and presently
she saw his gray head over the fence.</p>

<p>He opened the gate and came out to meet her.
“Why, little girl!” he exclaimed, “what are you
doing on this road? ’Tain’t your way from home.
Why, your face is cut and you’re all mussed up.
Tumble down?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Ezra! Ezra!” cried Jessie, seizing his hand,
“the pony cart upset us over the bank there by
the cut, and Adele has hurt her arm. The pony
is all right. He is standing just as still, but the
cart-wheel is off so we can’t get home, at least I
don’t know how to get Adele and the pony home.”</p>

<p>“Where did you say they were?” asked Ezra.</p>

<p>“On the other side of the gully, there by the
cut.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t come over the railroad bridge?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it was the shortest way,” said Jessie
simply.</p>

<p>Ezra uttered an exclamation. “You poor little
tot, what would your mother say? Suppose
you had slipped under the hand-rail and had fallen
into the water?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>“I shut my eyes when I got dizzy.”</p>

<p>“Humph! Well, you don’t go back, that’s
all. Come right in here and let my daughter
straighten you out, wash off that poor little battered
up face. Mark and I will go get the pony
and the little girl. What do ye say her name is?”</p>

<p>“Adele. Adele Hallett.”</p>

<p>Ezra nodded. “Belongs to the yellow house.
What ye been doing driving off in that direction
by yourselves, is what I want to know.”</p>

<p>Jessie was silent. She did not like to blame
Adele, though she knew it was entirely her
fault. “I told Adele I’d hurry back,” she said.</p>

<p>“You’re not going back,” declared Ezra.
“I’ll look after that young miss myself. Come
right in the house. Here, Kitty,” he spoke to a
young woman at the door. “Here’s Miss Loomis
that brought us those good apples. She’s had an
accident up the road a piece. Her and a young
miss was out driving, and as far as I can make
out they got catched on the railroad and a wheel
came off. You tidy her up a bit while Mark and
me goes after the other one.”</p>

<p>Jessie had often seen Ezra’s daughter as well
as her husband Mark, and she was quite willing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
to be taken indoors to have her face bathed, the
dirt brushed from her clothes and herself generally
looked after. There was a tremendous
bruise on her leg, one stocking was badly torn,
and the side of her face was scraped and sore
where she had fallen against the bank.</p>

<p>“It’s lucky you weren’t killed outright,” said
Kitty, when by dint of much questioning she
learned how the thing happened. “Pappy’ll be
back in no time. You just set still and wait for
him. I reckon your ma’ll be glad to see you
alive when she hears what’s went on.”</p>

<p>She established Jessie in a chair by the window
and continued her preparations for supper. In a
very short time Ezra and Mark were back again
with Adele in the wagon and Dapple Gray behind
it. “I conclude she has broken her arm,”
said Ezra to his daughter as he came into the
house. “There ain’t no time to lose in getting
her to the doctor to have it sot, so I think the
quickest way is to drive her right to Dr. Sadtler’s
and let him see what’s wrong. I ain’t said
nothin’ to her about what I think.”</p>

<p>“Pore little thing,” said Kitty, “she looks real
white.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>Jessie had flown to Adele. “I couldn’t come,”
she exclaimed. “Ezra wouldn’t let me. Do you
feel any better?”</p>

<p>“No.” Adele shook her head and her tears
broke out afresh. “I want to go home, I want
to go home,” she sobbed.</p>

<p>Ezra came out before Jessie had time for another
word. “You stay here, honey,” he said to
Jessie. “I’ll take this young lady to the doctor
and let him fix her up so she’ll feel better and
then we’ll come back for you.”</p>

<p>But Adele wailed out, “Go with me, Jessie.
Go with me. I don’t want to see the doctor all
alone.”</p>

<p>“Ezra will be with you,” said Jessie who was
feeling rather shaky herself.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, Ezra will be right with you,” said
that person, “and moreover this young miss isn’t
to go; she isn’t fit, all bruised up as she is. You
won’t be alone, bless you, child. There ain’t a
kinder woman in the country than Mrs. Sadtler,
and she’ll mother you fine. You’ll be all right in
no time. No, you don’t!” he stopped Jessie
from climbing into the wagon. Mark had unfastened
Dapple Gray and had tied him to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
hitching-post. “We’ll go for the cart after a
while,” said Ezra gathering up the reins. “You
wait here, child, and I’ll be back as quick as I
can.” So Jessie was obliged to see Adele drive
off while she was left to Kitty’s tender mercies.</p>

<i>The Gray Kitten</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a very subdued and wan little Adele who
was helped into the house by the doctor, who remained
to explain the situation, while Ezra took
Jessie home. Poor Miss Betty was overcome at
sight of her niece with her arm in splints and
looking so pale. “Child! child!” she cried.
“What has happened? We have been so anxious
about you. At first we thought you had gone
home with Jessie, but Otto said he saw you
driving in an opposite direction.” She turned to
the doctor. “What has happened?” she asked
tremulously.</p>

<p>“It seems the young ladies were crossing the
track just there by the cut and the wheel caught
in the track, upsetting their cart and throwing
them out. Fortunately there is no worse damage
done than a broken arm and a broken cart.”</p>

<p>“The horse ran away!” exclaimed Miss Betty.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it. Fine little beast that he is,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
he stood stock still. Little Loomis girl was
thrown into some bushes. She was stunned by
the fall, but seems all right otherwise except for
a few bruises. She was a little Trojan, Ezra
Limpett tells me, and tramped across that dangerous
railroad bridge to get help. You’d better
have this child put to bed, Miss Hallett, and I see
you look rather the worse for wear yourself.”</p>

<p>“I’ve had one of my headaches,” replied Miss
Betty, passing her hand over her forehead.</p>

<p>“Humph! Fine time to take for explorations.
I gather that’s what the youngsters were doing.
At least my wife says so.” The doctor spoke as
if he had no patience with such doings.</p>

<p>Miss Betty turned a troubled face upon Adele.
“Oh, my child, how could you?” she exclaimed.
“Didn’t you know we do not allow you to go
out of sight of the house?”</p>

<p>Adele burst into loud sobs. “There, there,”
said Miss Betty, soothingly; “I am sure you have
had punishment enough, and I won’t scold, but I
wish your father had never bought you that pony.
I shall never have an easy day after this.”</p>

<p>“The pony is all right,” declared the doctor.
“He had the good sense not to run when he felt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
the wheel going. He is a fine little fellow and
it is due to his good behavior that the children
came to no worse mishap. I’ll leave a quieting
draught for the child, Miss Hallett, and something
for that head of yours.”</p>

<p>“My head was better,” said Miss Betty weakly.</p>

<p>“This won’t come amiss,” replied the doctor,
putting a few tablets into a small phial. “Get the
child to bed and go yourself. I’ll come again in
the morning.”</p>

<p>So while those in the yellow house were looking
after Adele, Jessie was being driven home
behind Ezra’s old white horse and was delivered
safe, if not quite sound, into her mother’s arms.</p>

<p>As it was getting late Mrs. Loomis was getting
anxious, and was about to send Max to the Halletts’
after his little sister. Ezra had not waited
for thanks, but as soon as he had set Jessie safely
down before her own door he drove off at as
rapid a pace as his old horse could travel. At
Jessie’s sudden appearance looking as if she had
been through the wars her mother cried out:
“Why, my child, what is the matter? How did
you get such a scratched face? and look at your
stocking torn to shreds.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>“Well, I vow!” exclaimed Walter, “you do
look a sight! Been climbing trees, I bet.”</p>

<p>“Indeed I’ve not,” returned Jessie. “I can
climb trees, but I haven’t done it to-day. I’ll
tell you, mother, but I don’t want to before
Walter.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right,” said that person indifferently,
“I don’t want to know.”</p>

<p>Jessie slipped her hand into her mother’s.</p>

<p>“Come up-stairs,” she said in a whisper, “and I’ll
show you my leg.”</p>

<p>“Your leg?” Mrs. Loomis began to look
alarmed, and led Jessie up-stairs. “My dear
child,” she said when they had entered Jessie’s
little room, “what has happened?”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t my fault, indeed it wasn’t,” began
Jessie trying to be brave, but now that she was
in the safe harbor of her mother’s arms, feeling
that she could not keep back the tears. “I tried
to make Adele stop, and not go out of sight, but
she just would and would go further and further.
She was bent and determined to go as far as she
could, and I was afraid to let her go off by herself,
and yet I knew it wasn’t right for us to be
driving out of sight. I truly didn’t know what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
to do, mother. She wouldn’t let me drive nor get
out nor anything and she wouldn’t go back, so all
I could do was to sit still. Then she drove bias
across the railroad truck, and the wheel caught,
and we were tipped out. I fell down into some
bushes and got an awful bruise. Just see.” She
displayed a large black and blue surface to her
mother.</p>

<p>“Why, you poor child, that certainly is a bruise.
I must bathe it after a while. But now go on
with your story.” Mrs. Loomis’s hands trembled
as she held Jessie closer.</p>

<p>“Then,” continued the little girl, “when I
came to my senses I didn’t see Adele at first, but
I saw Dapple Gray standing quite still by the
railroad track. A cart-wheel was off and the
cart was tipped down the bank. But wasn’t
Dapple Gray good not to move?”</p>

<p>“He was indeed, but oh, my little daughter, I
dare not think what might have happened. Suppose
a train had been coming along.”</p>

<p>“One did whistle. It was a freight train, I
think, but it must have passed before we got
there. Well, I picked myself up and found Adele
sitting there crying about her arm. She has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
broken it, mother, but we didn’t know it then
and there wasn’t any house nearer than Ezra’s so
I went there.” She hesitated for a moment before
going on. “It was so much nearer not to
go across the foot-bridge, so I went the other
way.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Jessie!” Mrs. Loomis turned pale.</p>

<p>“Yes, I did. I knew that perhaps I ought not,
but it would save time, you see. I did get
awfully dizzy just in the middle, but I shut my
eyes and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“‘God shall charge His angel legions</div>
<div class="indent">Watch and ward o’er thee to keep,’</div>
</div></div>

<p>and presently I felt all right, so I got over safely
and found Ezra—oh, dear, he hasn’t had his supper.
Isn’t that too bad!—and Kitty washed my
face and fixed me up while Ezra and Mark went
for Adele and took her to the doctor. Then they
stopped for me and we all took Adele home and
then Ezra brought me.”</p>

<p>“My darling child, what a dreadful time you
have had,” exclaimed Mrs. Loomis.</p>

<p>“I haven’t told any one but you about Adele,
mother, truly I haven’t. I never said to any one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
that it was her fault. Could I help it happening?
What ought I to have done?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Loomis was silent for a moment. “It was
a very hard position for a little girl, so hard that
I do not see how I can consent to your being
thrown with so wilful a child as Adele. I am
afraid for the consequences.”</p>

<p>“Oh, mother!” There were surprise and regret
in Jessie’s tones. “Am I never to play with
her again, poor Adele! And am I never to go to
the yellow house? Not for lessons or anything?
Oh, mother!”</p>

<p>“I shall have to think it over, dear, and have
a talk with your father before we can decide. It
is a very serious matter for us to have our only
dear little girl placed in such danger as you were
in to-day. So far as you were concerned I really
do not see how you can be blamed, and you tried
to be brave and noble for Adele’s sake, but we
must make it impossible for such a thing to happen
again. Now, come down and have some
supper, and then I think you’d better go to bed,
for it has been a very exciting day for you.
There will be no lessons to-morrow and you’d better
not get up very early.” She did not say that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
she still felt anxious lest Jessie had suffered more
from the accident than at once appeared.</p>

<p>The next morning Jessie woke up feeling stiff
and sore, and was glad when Max came up with
her breakfast. He had added some ripe persimmons
to her bill of fare and was so kind and solicitous
that Jessie quite enjoyed the reputation of
invalid. Walter, too, poked his head in the door
and asked how she was feeling, blundering out a
half apology by saying, “Why didn’t you tell a
fellow what was the matter when you came in?”
Then he tossed a little pale pink rose on the bed
and ran away. The rose was the last of the season
and he had found it braving the frost which
had sweetened the persimmons. Minerva, also,
came up with a plate of tiny hot biscuits which
she had baked especially for the little girl.</p>

<p>Later in the day Max was sent over to inquire
how Adele was, and brought back the report that
she was doing very well but had had a feverish
night. By the time Max had returned Jessie had
found bed rather a tiresome place and so had
begged to be allowed to get up and come down.</p>

<p>Her father looked her over, asked many questions
and finally decided that the big bruise was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
her worst hurt and that she could go out and in
as she pleased. “Run out-of-doors all you want
to,” he said, “but don’t get tired out,” so Jessie
availed herself of this permission and concluded
to go hunt up the boys.</p>

<p>She found them in the barn amusing themselves
with Eb. He had learned to say, “Hallo!” and
was walking back and forth on a beam, cocking
his eye and looking down at the boys below.</p>

<p>“He’s a funny fellow,” said Max as Jessie came
in. “I’d like to take him back to school. We’re
going Monday. Carl is all right, they say.”</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“It certainly would make the children laugh and play</div>

</div></div>

<p>said Max.</p>

<p>“Ho, I can do better than that,” boasted Walter.</p>

</div></div>

<p>“What is a sloe?” asked Jessie.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know,” said Walter. “Ask
Max. He is the walking dictionary.”</p>

<p>“It is a kind of plum, I believe,” Max told
them.</p>

<p>“I never saw a plum as black as Ebon is,” said
Jessie, stroking the shining feathers of the bird
who had flown down and was sitting on her wrist.</p>

<p>“And I suppose you never saw a green rose,
but I have,” returned Max.</p>

<p>“Where did you see it?” Jessie asked.</p>

<p>“In a greenhouse, Mr. Atkinson’s.”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose plums could be black,” said
Jessie persuaded that Max knew what he was
talking about.</p>

<p>“Look at Eb pecking at your buttons, Jess,”
said Walter. “He has one almost off.”</p>

<p>Jessie wore a red jacket whose bright buttons
pleased Ebon’s fancy. “He is getting to be a
great mischief,” she said. “He tried to carry off
mother’s thimble yesterday. Go ’long, Eb. Go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
pretend you are a chicken or something. Max,
will you go with me to Effie Hinsdale’s to get my
kitten? It is big enough now, and if I am not to
go to Adele’s any more I shall need the kitten.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go with her,” proposed Walter. “Then
we can see Jack and some of the other boys.
We’ll go, Jess.”</p>

<p>Walter was very amiable to-day, Jessie thought.
He really loved his little sister, and the fact that
she had been in great danger the day before
made him realize what it would be to lose her.</p>

<p>“We might get both kittens,” said Jessie,
“and then we could leave Adele’s for her on our
way home. She will be so glad to have it now
that she has a broken arm and no one to play with.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose her father will sell Dapple
Gray?” said Walter. “I wish our father could
buy him.”</p>

<p>“Adele would feel awfully to have him sold,”
said Jessie. “Oh, dear!” she drew a long sigh.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Max anxiously.</p>

<p>“Nothing much. I was only thinking what a
pity it is that things can’t always go right.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see what possessed you two to go off
that way,” said Walter reading her thoughts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>“I don’t either,” returned Jessie turning away.
“I’m going up to the house now to get a basket
for the kittens.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe she had a thing to do with it,”
said Max to his brother when Jessie was out of
hearing. “I’ll bet it was the Hallett girl that
wanted to have her way, and Jess won’t tell on
her.”</p>

<p>“That’s pretty decent of Jess then,” said Walter,
“and it was pretty fine of that pony not to
bolt when the wheel came off. I’ll tell you a
pony like that is worth having. Ezra said he
stood as still as a post till they led him away.”</p>

<p>“I reckon Mr. Hallett won’t want to give him
up,” returned Max.</p>

<p>“But he’ll not let those two kids go driving
off by themselves again,” remarked Walter with
the superiority of his years, which were but two
more than Jessie’s.</p>

<p>Jessie with her two brothers made the visit to
the Hinsdales, and Jessie bore away the gray
kitten in triumph, but her pleasure was marred
by finding that the black kitten had been given
to a cousin of the cook’s, so there was none for
Adele.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>“I am so sorry,” said Effie, “but Adele shall
have first choice of the next batch.”</p>

<p>“She’ll be dreadfully disappointed,” said Jessie
sadly.</p>

<p>“I am so sorry,” repeated Effie, “and if there
were one left she should have it, but we never take
the last one from Tippy, you see; that wouldn’t
be right, and yours is the last one left to give.”</p>

<p>Jessie hugged her own furry darling to her,
and, the boys having called out that they
couldn’t wait any longer, she was obliged to join
them, but all the way home she was struggling
with a problem. Ought she to give up the gray
kitten to Adele? Poor Adele had no brothers
and no mother, and, if Jessie must give her up,
she would have no playmate. Although Adele
had been the means of getting them both into
serious trouble, Jessie felt the sorrier for her
on account of her very naughtiness, and somehow
could only think of her friend as she was in
her most charming moods. When she chose,
Adele could be the most fascinating of companions,
and Jessie believed that her love was very
genuine, so the more she thought of it the more
she felt that she ought to give up the kitten.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>However, she decided not to make up her mind
right away, and in the meantime she need not
let Adele know that the gray kitten had been
taken away from Effie’s. But while she was
weighing the matter in her own mind came a
note from Adele that settled the question. It
arrived the next morning, and was the outcome
of a visit from Effie who had literally let the
cat out of the bag when she went to see how
Adele was. The note ran thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You don’t love me, for you haven’t been to
see me and I suppose you think I am too bad to
play with. You can go to your old Polly and
stay with her all the time. I shall not trubble
you, but I want my Peter Pan and I know Polly
has stoled him to spite me. Efy says you have
your kiten. What made you take it when there
wassent any for me? Oh, I am verry miserble
with nobuddy to play with. If Polly dossent
send back my Peter Pan I am going to burn her
up. Her scraggy hair would make a luvly blaze.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">“Your forsakened frend,</span><br>
“<span class="smcap">Adele</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>At the end was a tear-stained postscript which
read: “I did love you. I did, I did.”</p>

<p>Evidently Adele was in one of her worst<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
moods and was feeling very remorseful and unhappy.
This Jessie knew, but at the same time
she was indignant that Adele should still harp
upon Polly’s wickedness. Of course it was very
absurd for her to say such things, for how could
Polly steal anything? Yet the note quite decided
Jessie not to give up the gray kitten, and
her pity for Adele suffered a change.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was some time before the two little girls
met, for Mrs. Loomis could not make up her mind
to allow Jessie to go over to the yellow house,
while Miss Betty and Miss Eloise appreciated the
fact that there was reason for hard feelings
against Adele, and moreover thought that nothing
would make the little sinner realize her misdoing
more than such a punishment as a separation
from Jessie. Mrs. Loomis had not failed to
get daily reports of Adele’s progress and sent
her over many dainties while she was in bed, so
that Adele’s remorse was all the greater.</p>

<p>Jessie answered the note by saying she was
very sorry about the kitten, but she did not refer
to Peter Pan nor to Playmate Polly. For a
whole week she was obliged to spend her time
with her old companions, for the boys returned
to school as expected, so Eb and the gray kitten
were a great source of solace. Eb took a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
fancy to Cloudy, and it was very funny to see
him, with outspread wings, hopping after the
prancing kitten who was in no way afraid of him,
and who would give him little impertinent dabs
when he came too near. He infinitely preferred
Cloudy to the chickens.</p>

<p>Finally when a week had gone by, and Jessie,
who had avoided the brook for some days, was
again playing with Peter Pan and Playmate
Polly, she looked across the little stream to see a
wistful pair of dark eyes gazing at her. “Oh,
Adele!” she cried, “are you able to come out
again?”</p>

<p>A flashing smile changed the expression of
Adele’s face. “I was so afraid you wouldn’t
speak to me,” she exclaimed. “I can’t come
over, for I am trying awfully hard to be good.
Can’t you come to this side?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not,” replied Jessie slowly, “but
perhaps if each stays on her own side we can
have some sort of play and won’t be disobedient
either.”</p>

<p>“I think that will be lovely,” cried Adele.
“What can we play? I can use only my right
arm, you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>“Will it be a long time before you can use the
other?” asked Jessie interestedly.</p>

<p>“Not so very, very long. The doctor says it is
doing very well indeed, but oh, Jessie, it has been
awful without you.”</p>

<p>“Are you having lessons?”</p>

<p>“No, not yet. Aunt Betty hasn’t said anything
about that, and—and,” the tears came to
her eyes, “if you are not there I shall hate lessons
worse than ever. I was getting so I didn’t
mind them.”</p>

<p>“It is too bad,” returned Jessie.</p>

<p>“I suppose your mother thinks I am too wicked
for you to play with,” remarked Adele after an
awkward pause.</p>

<p>“Well,—not exactly,” Jessie wondered how
she could explain, “but you see she is afraid we’ll
get into some mischief.”</p>

<p>“I know, I know,” returned Adele. “I suppose
I am very wicked, but I shall never want to
be good if we can’t be friends.”</p>

<p>Jessie pondered for a moment over this speech.
It made her feel a great responsibility. She
wondered if her mother knew that Adele was in
danger of becoming very, very wicked, if it would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
make any difference in her decision about their
friendship. Certainly it was a subject that
needed to be discussed, and it should be done
that very night when Jessie and her mother had
their last little talk before Mrs. Loomis kissed her
daughter good-night. For the present it would
be best not to talk about it, and so she said, “I’ll
tell you what we can do; we can send boats back
and forth to each other. You can stay on one
end of the log and I will stay on the other.”</p>

<p>“If I come to the middle, will you come and
kiss me?” asked Adele.</p>

<p>Jessie thought there could be no harm in doing
that upon strictly neutral ground. “But we
mustn’t stay there,” she concluded.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, we won’t stay there,” agreed Jessie.
So they proceeded to the middle of the log that
spanned the brook, fervently kissed one another,
and then retreated each to her own side.</p>

<p>“I’ll get some chips,” said Jessie, “and throw
some over to you. We ought to have some
string, too. Oh, I know where there is some; in
the grotto I had a little ball of it the other day,
and I put it there to keep it safe.”</p>

<p>“Is the grotto just the same?” asked Adele<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
wistfully. “I should so love to see it. I wish I
could come over just for a minute. Do you
think I might?”</p>

<p>Jessie shook her head decidedly. “No, I don’t
think you ought. Of course I’d love to have
you, but it would be disobeying; even doing it
once would be disobeying.”</p>

<p>“It is very hard to be perfectly good,” returned
Adele woefully.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is,” sighed Jessie, “but when we are
sure a thing is wrong we ought not to do it.
Sometimes you aren’t quite sure, and sometimes
you forget. Forgetting is my worst sin,” she
added solemnly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what mine is, my very worst, I
mean. When I begin to think about them I am
afraid to go to bed at night.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Mother always——” began Jessie and
then she remembered that there was no mother
to whom Adele could unburden her conscience
and from whom she could receive loving advice
and comfort. She therefore changed the subject
quickly. “I am going to get the string and the
chips,” she said, “and I will send you over a load
of persimmons. Do you like them? I brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
some with me this morning. They are so
good now that we have had frost. I don’t
suppose I can send more than one or two at a
time.”</p>

<p>Adele was delighted at the prospect of receiving
such a valuable cargo which by dint of a
long switch Jessie managed to pilot safely over
to a spot where Adele could reach it. The second
expedition was not so successful, however, but
was lost in the raging torrent before it was half-way
across. When a vessel is only six inches
long it is very hard to navigate among the whirlpools
of an uncertain stream. Nevertheless at
least half a dozen persimmons reached the other
shore and were duly consumed by the person to
whom they were consigned.</p>

<p>“There will be chestnuts pretty soon,” said
Jessie. “I shouldn’t wonder if there were some
now. We might go and get some. Oh, I forgot
they are on this side. Never mind, I will get
Sam to gather some and to-morrow I can send
you over a lot. I can put them in a basket and
tie the basket on a long pole and in that way I
can reach them over to you. Oh, I wonder if
the boys took all those they gathered. I am going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
to the barn to see, and if they didn’t I’ll
bring all I can. Just wait a minute.”</p>

<p>She ran off to the barn and pretty soon came
back. She stopped on the way to put something
in the grotto, and then went on to the brook
with a small covered basket. “I’d better tie it
on this pole,” she said, “for it might fall off. It is
full of chestnuts. When you have emptied them
send the basket back to me, and I will put something
else in it.”</p>

<p>“What will you put in it?” asked Adele watching
Jessie tie the basket securely to the pole.</p>

<p>“That is a secret,” said Jessie laughing.</p>

<p>By going upon the log she was able to reach
far enough so that Adele could get the basket
which was unfastened and sent back after it had
been emptied of its contents. “I think you were
lovely to send me all these,” said Adele delightedly.</p>

<p>“Oh, we shall have plenty more,” Jessie told
her. “Sam says there are lots down in the big
field. You shall have some of those, too. Now
be very careful when you untie the basket this
time. It isn’t for you to keep always, but only
for a little while.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>While Adele was puzzling over this, Jessie
went off to the grotto from which she abstracted
something. She kept her back to Adele, and
was some time in getting the basket settled to
suit her. “I am just crazy to see what it is,” said
Adele excitedly.</p>

<p>Jessie laughed and this time went further out
upon the log carrying the pole very carefully and
reaching it out to where Adele stood at the other
end of the log. “Go a little further away when
you open the basket,” she suggested, and Adele,
wondering, obeyed.</p>

<p>She opened the lid of the basket and peeped in.
“Oh!” she cried, “how lovely!”</p>

<p>“He has only come for a visit,” said Jessie
hurriedly. “His name is Cloudy, you know. I
thought you might like to see him.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t he a darling?” said Adele snuggling the
kitten up against her face.</p>

<p>Jessie watched her with a serious countenance.
Presently she said rather breathlessly, “Would
you like to call him half yours? I don’t believe
I could give him to you altogether, but we might
go shares, you know.”</p>

<p>Adele sat down with the kitten in her lap.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
“Jessie Loomis, I think you are the dearest girl
that ever lived,” she said earnestly, “and I should
love to come over there and hug you, but I won’t,
because I must be good. No, I won’t let you
give me even half the kitten, but I do love to
have him come over for a visit. See, he is sleepy.
Shall I put him back in the basket and let him
have a nap?”</p>

<p>“He has just had a big saucer of milk,” said
Jessie, “but he is very playful most of the time.
You might let him have a little nap, and I will
find something else to send over to you.”</p>

<p>“No, let me send something this time; you
have done it all,” said Adele. “I’ll go up to the
house in a minute and get something. Would
you mind if I took Cloudy to show to Aunt Betty
and Miss Eloise? I won’t let anything happen to
him and I’ll bring him right back.”</p>

<p>“Of course you may take him,” Jessie consented
generously. And carrying the basket
steadily, Adele sped away.</p>

<p>She was not gone very long and when she
came back she brought a small paper bag of cakes
and another of candies which were promptly despatched
across the watery way to Jessie; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
as Cloudy was asleep in the basket the little bags
themselves were tied on the pole and were transported
in that way.</p>

<p>“Aunt Betty said Cloudy was lovely,” said
Adele, “and he behaved beautifully. I told her
how generous you offered to be, and she sent her
love to you.”</p>

<p>“What did Miss Eloise say?”</p>

<p>“She wasn’t there. Aunt Betty said she had
gone somewhere, but she didn’t say where. I
asked Aunt Betty if she thought papa would
bring me a kitten from the city, and she said he
was going to bring me a big dog in place of
Dapple Gray. I’d love a big dog.”</p>

<p>“But where is Dapple Gray?” asked Jessie.</p>

<p>“He’s been sent away,” said Adele in a low
voice. “Papa said as long as I couldn’t be
trusted that I couldn’t have him to drive till I
was old enough to have common sense, and so he
has sent him to my cousin till my sense grows
enough for me to have him again. Do you suppose
common sense does grow?”</p>

<p>“I think it must,” returned Jessie thoughtfully,
“for all grown people have it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe they do,” said Adele, “for I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
have heard papa say ever so many times that So-and-So
had not a grain of common sense, and So-and-So
would be a big man, too.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe they get it and then lose it,”
replied Jessie, “like some persons do their hair.
Some persons have a great deal, and others are
quite bald, you know, like Dr. Sadtler.”</p>

<p>This seemed a reasonable conclusion and Adele
accepted it. “Well,” she said, “I hope if I ever
do get my common sense that it will be nice and
thick and long like Miss Eloise’s hair.”</p>

<p>“Is your cousin a little girl?” asked Jessie returning
to her thoughts of Dapple Gray.</p>

<p>“No, he is a little boy, and he has been very
ill, so papa said it would be a great comfort to
him to have a little pony like that.”</p>

<p>“Is he a big boy?” asked Jessie.</p>

<p>“About as big as your brother Max.”</p>

<p>“He will hate to give Dapple Gray up?” said
Jessie.</p>

<p>“Maybe he will be strong and well again by
the time my common sense gets here,” said
Adele. “I hope that won’t be so very long.”</p>

<p>“I hope so, too,” replied Jessie, thinking more
of Dapple Gray than of Adele’s development.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>“Cloudy is waking up,” said Adele. “I’d
better send him back to you.”</p>

<p>“Tie the basket on very strongly,” said Jessie,
“so it can’t fall in the water.”</p>

<p>But though Adele tied the basket securely
enough, she was not quite so certain of her own
footing, her useless arm causing her to lose her
balance, and in regaining it she allowed the pole
to drop so far that the basket was dipped into the
water, though fortunately not so far that Cloudy
received more wetting than gave him two dripping
paws.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, I am so relieved,” said Adele. “I
thought he was drowned. Why am I always
doing such dreadful things?”</p>

<p>“You couldn’t help it,” Jessie assured her.
“You have only one arm, you see, and it was
very hard to manage that long pole.” She dried
Cloudy’s paws on her handkerchief and then cuddled
him under her jacket. “I think I shall have
to carry him up to the house,” she said, “for he
might take cold. Besides, I am sure it must be
nearly dinner time.”</p>

<p>“We have had a perfectly lovely time,” returned
Adele. “I was so miserable last night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
when I went to bed, and I cried myself to
sleep.”</p>

<p>“What made you so miserable?”</p>

<p>“Why, you see Dapple Gray went away yesterday
afternoon, and I felt so lonely when I
thought I couldn’t have you or him either. I am
so glad you came down to the brook this morning.
Will you come again this afternoon?”</p>

<p>“If mother says I may.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to tell her?”</p>

<p>“Tell her what?”</p>

<p>“That you have been playing with me all the
morning.”</p>

<p>“Of course I shall tell her. I tell her everything,
and you know we have minded exactly,
for neither one of us has crossed the brook.
Mother never said I couldn’t talk to you; she
only said I was not to go over to your place.”</p>

<p>“And Aunt Betty said I mustn’t go to your
place, so we really have minded them, haven’t
we?”</p>

<p>“I should think we had,” replied Jessie.
“Good-bye.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” responded Adele. And both little
girls went off feeling very virtuous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>Jessie did not delay in telling her mother all
about the morning’s meeting. “Do you mind,
mother?” she asked.</p>

<p>“No,” answered her mother. “I don’t think
I do in the least. I see that you both meant to
be obedient, and I think the hard lesson Adele
has had promises to do her a great deal of good.”</p>

<p>“I feel so sorry for her, oh, so sorry,” said
Jessie thoughtfully. “She cried herself to sleep
last night because she was so lonely. If she had
had you, mother, to tuck her up and kiss her
good-night and to make her feel comfortable inside,
as you do me after I have been naughty, she
wouldn’t have felt so.”</p>

<p>“Poor little child,” said Mrs. Loomis compassionately.</p>

<p>“I think she loves me very much,” said Jessie,
“and she did just as I told her was right this
morning. She never said one word about Polly
or Peter Pan, either. Don’t you think I can be
friends with her again, mother?”</p>

<p>“I think you can, for I am sure that you
can do a great deal for her. It is evident that
she has never been used to giving her confidences
to her aunt, and so far, Miss Eloise has not been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
able to win them. I think Miss Eloise will in
time, and meanwhile we must do all we can.
Miss Eloise was here this morning, dearie.”</p>

<p>“Was she? Then that is why she was not at
home when Adele took Cloudy up to show her.
What did she say, mother?”</p>

<p>“She said a great many things, and some things
she said made me decide to let you begin your lessons
again, but I would rather you did not spend
too much time at the yellow house. If you go
there in the morning, that will be enough, and in
the afternoon it will be better for Adele to come
here to play with you. I think it is getting too
cold to play by the brook, but there is the attic
where you can be perfectly safe. I will have
one end cleared for you, and you can have all
your playthings up there.” Jessie threw her
arms around her mother’s neck. “You are just
the dearest mother in the world,” she cried. “I
wish Adele had one exactly like you. May I just
go down to the brook a few minutes this afternoon
and tell her, and may I bring her back with
me?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Loomis smiled down at the eager face as
she gave her consent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>“Just one thing more,” said Jessie. “Do you
mind if I stay long enough to shut up Peter
Pan’s house for the winter? It won’t take long.”</p>

<p>“No, Miss Wendy, I don’t mind, if you will
promise to mind the tree tops.”</p>

<p>Jessie laughed, and felt very thankful that she
had such a mother.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Lessons</span> began again the next day, and this
time continued without interruption until the
holidays. It would not be quite true to say that
there were never any more tantrums, but it is a
fact that they were less violent, and occurred less
frequently. Adele really was trying to improve,
and if Jessie herself once in a while had what
Adele called “the pouts” and always mocked
and made fun of her, Jessie was ashamed to
continue them for very long, for she hated to be
made fun of. The two had their little quarrels,
to be sure, and sometimes did not speak for as
much as a whole day, but night usually brought
regret and the next morning each would be eager
to make up.</p>

<p>One day Jessie coming home from school found
her mother counting the silver. “Jessie,” she
said, “do you remember taking any of these
small teaspoons at any time?”</p>

<p>“Why no, mother,” returned Jessie. “I always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
have a kitchen spoon, you know, and I
haven’t had one of those for a long time, not
since that day I had the marmalade down by the
brook.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see where they can have gone,” said
Mrs. Loomis. “There are two missing, and I
am sure they were all here last week. Minerva
is very careful and I don’t think she could possibly
have thrown them out. You are quite sure
that you and Adele have not had them up in the
attic?”</p>

<p>“I am quite sure,” returned Jessie, “but I will
go and look.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would,” said her mother.</p>

<p>Jessie trudged up to the attic and searched
among the playthings, but there were no spoons
to be seen. She went back to her mother.
“They are not there,” she said. “Adele and I
haven’t had anything but dolls’ parties up there,
and then we used the spoons that belong to the
play tea-set.”</p>

<p>“I cannot think where they can be,” repeated
Mrs. Loomis.</p>

<p>“Perhaps the boys had them down at the barn
or somewhere,” suggested Jessie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>“But I have counted them since they went
back to school, and they were all here. I have
looked everywhere I can think of, and so has
Minerva. They are never taken to the kitchen
except to be washed, and the only person who
has been along is that old peddler who comes
with tins sometimes. I have always thought
him an honest old soul, as peddlers go, but I can
think of no one else.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it was the peddler,” said Jessie.
“He has been coming here for a long time,
and he is always very nice and kind. He gave
me a ring with a blue set in it one day because
he said he liked little girls, and that he once had
a little daughter about my age who died. I am
sure it couldn’t be the peddler.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t seem to me so either,” returned
Mrs. Loomis, “but where are the spoons?”</p>

<p>Jessie shook her head, and the loss remained a
mystery, for no amount of searching brought
them to light. It even became more and more
mystifying, for in a few days a little coffee-spoon
was missing. It was a souvenir spoon
which had been sent to Mrs. Loomis by her
sister, and had been left on Mrs. Loomis’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
dressing bureau after the box containing it was
opened.</p>

<p>“This is more and more perplexing,” said Mrs.
Loomis, “for I know positively that I left it in
my room, and who in the world could go up
there without my knowledge?”</p>

<p>This was the last spoon taken, and although
the matter was not forgotten it was after a while
dropped, all concluding that in some unexplained
way the spoons had fallen behind the surbase or
through a crack in the floor. This might explain
the disappearance of the teaspoons, for
there was a large crack in the kitchen floor near
the fireplace, but it could not account for the
coffee-spoon. “I’ll have that board in the
kitchen taken up in the spring,” said Mr. Loomis.
“We don’t want to take the stove down now,
and no doubt you will find the other in your
room somewhere when the spring cleaning is
done.” So the matter rested.</p>

<p>When Jessie told Adele about the loss she declared
that Playmate Polly had taken them. It
was her way to charge Playmate Polly with all
sorts of evil traits, and the two little girls quarreled
upon this subject oftener than any other,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
absurd as it was. If Adele wanted to tease
Jessie she had but to say something disagreeable
about Playmate Polly, and Jessie’s anger
would rise, so that it finally became as a red rag
to a bull, and the more Adele teased the more Jessie
resented it.</p>

<p>They seldom played by the brook now, but the
attic was a great source of pleasure. It was well
heated by a register, so there was no danger that
the children should take cold. A set of shelves
on one side made a fine playhouse, and Sam had
made a low table of just the proper height. It
was a rough sort of affair, but served its purpose.
The legs of two old chairs were sawed down to
suit the children and a bit of old carpet was
spread upon the floor, so they considered that the
playroom was finely furnished. Minerva put up
a little white curtain at the window, and would
always remember them on baking days with a
little pie, a pan of tiny rolls, or some small cakes,
so that Saturday was feast day as well as holiday.</p>

<p>One Saturday the two children were sitting at
the table coloring some pictures in a couple of
old magazines. Mr. Hallett had brought them
each a small paint box the night before and they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
took this first opportunity of trying their powers.
Cloudy, attired in the long white frock belonging
to Jessie’s baby doll, was asleep in an improvised
crib made of a small stool turned upside down.
He seemed perfectly satisfied and was having a
good nap. Charity sat by his side in the character
of nurse, and Peter Pan was sitting in a swing
which hung from the rafters.</p>

<p>“I think I shall put a red frock on my lady,”
Adele said.</p>

<p>“I tried red,” said Jessie, “but it doesn’t go
very well. It is kind of thick and messy looking.
I believe I will try this yellow.” They worked
away for a few moments, very much absorbed in
their painting, but they were interrupted by a
faint mew from the crib. “The baby is waking
up,” said Jessie, “and he can’t walk about very
well in that long frock. I shall have to take it
off, I suppose, so he can run about.”</p>

<p>“But he does look so cunning in it,” said Adele
admiringly.</p>

<p>“I know he does, and I can put it on again
after a while, but mother says I have no right to
make him uncomfortable, and to keep him from
playing when he wants to, so it will have to come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
off, and when he gets sleepy I can put it on again.
Oh, what’s that?”</p>

<p>Adele ran to the window and drew aside the
curtain. “Why, it’s Eb,” she exclaimed. “He
is pecking at the window. He wants to come in.
Shall I open the window, Jessie?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes. It won’t do any harm to let him
stay with us. I wonder how he found his way.
You might leave the window open, Adele. It is
real warm to-day and then he can go out when
he wants to.”</p>

<p>“I see how he came,” said Adele looking out
the window.</p>

<p>“He couldn’t fly as high as this with his wings
clipped.”</p>

<p>“No, but he could fly as high as the smokehouse
door. It is open, you see, and then he
could fly on the roof, and from there to the
branch of that big tree. He could walk along
the branch, you see, and get up here.”</p>

<p>“So he could, quite easily, and I suppose that
is the way he came. It is the first time he has
found us. See how pleased he is,” for Eb was
walking about in the most insinuating manner,
dipping and curtseying and making enticing little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
sounds. “Don’t let him drink the paint water,
Adele; it might make him ill. No, Eb, you can’t
have that,” for Eb, attracted by the bright colors
in the box, was trying to peck at them. Jessie
shut her box, and Adele did likewise. Then Eb
spied the kitten and sidled up to him. The girls
watched the two in their funny antics until
they heard Minerva calling at the foot of the
stairs.</p>

<p>Jessie ran down to her, and presently came
back with a little apple pie which she set on the
table. “Doesn’t it look good?” she said.
“Shall we eat it now?”</p>

<p>“We might as well,” returned Adele.</p>

<p>“I brought up some milk for the kitten,” said
Jessie, “so he can sit on one side the table and
Eb on the other. I have a stale crust up here
that I will soak in the milk and give to Eb. He
will like that.” So the funny company sat down
together, the kitten perched on a high box with
a small saucer of milk before him, Eb with his
soaked crust on a piece of pasteboard, and the
two girls, each with half a pie. Eb was the first
to finish his meal and then he flew down to see
what other entertainment the place afforded. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
went prying around for a few minutes before he
spied Adele’s paint brush which she had neglected
to put away. The piece of bright metal at one
end attracted him and in a moment he was upon
the window sill with the brush in his beak. Jessie
spied him just as he was about to take flight.</p>

<p>“Oh, see what Eb has!” she cried. “Shut
the window quick!”</p>

<p>Adele, who was nearest, jumped up, but Eb
was too quick for her and was beyond reach before
she could get to him. “He’s gone,” she
cried. “He has gone off with my brush. How
shall we get it?”</p>

<p>“You stay here and watch him,” said Jessie,
“and I will go down and see if I can grab him before
he gets away with it.”</p>

<p>She ran downstairs while Adele watched from
the window. Still carrying the brush, Eb
walked across the roof to the limb of the tree
which overhung one side of the house. He took
a short flight to the limb, walked along it, flew
to the smokehouse and stood there. The door,
however, was shut by now, and he was not sure
that he could venture to fly down from the roof.
Now was Jessie’s time. She ran to the kitchen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>“Give me some dough or corn bread, or something,
quick, Minerva,” she said.</p>

<p>Minerva picked up a piece of corn bread from
a plate and gave it to her. “What in the world
is the matter with the child?” she said as Jessie
scurried out. She followed the little girl to
where she stood crumbling the corn bread into
one palm. “Well, I declare,” she said. “What
has he got now?”</p>

<p>“Adele’s paint brush,” Jessie told her. “Come,
Eb. Come get some nice supper.”</p>

<p>Eb cocked his head to one side, and regarded
the outstretched hand for a moment, then he
dropped the paint brush and flew down to Jessie’s
shoulder. The paint brush rolled down from the
roof to the ground. Scattering the crumbs before
him, Jessie set Eb down, and ran back,
stopping under the window from which Adele
was looking and calling up to her, “Here it is.
I made him drop it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll come down and get it,” replied Adele.</p>

<p>“Bring Cloudy with you,” Jessie called back.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Adele appeared with Cloudy
in her arms. “I shut the window,” she said. “It
is getting dark up there, and I suppose I shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
have Angelina coming for me in a few minutes.
I am glad you were able to make Eb give up the
brush. What do you suppose he was going to do
with it? Isn’t he getting to be a thief?”</p>

<p>“He certainly is,” said Jessie. “I suppose he
was going to hide it somewhere.”</p>

<p>“I wonder where?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know. Where do you suppose
he would hide things, Minerva?”</p>

<p>“Bless me, I’m sure I can’t tell. Well, there,
I shouldn’t be the least surprised if he was the
one that stole those spoons. It is a wonder none
of us thought of that. It’s only lately he’s taken
to carrying off things, though. He tried to get
my thimble off my finger yesterday.”</p>

<p>“I’m going right in to tell mother about him,”
said Jessie, “and maybe we can find the spoons
if he has hidden them.”</p>

<p>Minerva followed the two children into the
sitting-room, where Mrs. Loomis was told of the
suspicion which rested upon Eb. “Well, I declare,”
she said. “I verily believe he is the
thief. We must watch him, and see where he
goes. Keep your eyes open, children, and perhaps
we can trace him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>However, Eb was much too sly to be discovered
at once, and despite all their efforts they
could not find out where he made a hiding-place
for his treasures. He was even given the chance
to carry away certain articles, but as soon as he
saw that he was followed he would drop what he
carried and would fly off with a caw of derision.
“He is the cleverest creature I ever saw,” declared
Minerva. “There is no catching him napping.
I let him carry off a piece of my red
worsted this morning, and would you believe it, he
dropped it on the step as soon as I opened the door.”</p>

<p>“We’ll catch him unawares some time,” said
Sam.</p>

<p>But as if he knew himself suspected, Eb continued
to behave with such secrecy that no one
could say that he was really the thief, and finally
Jessie declared that she didn’t believe he was
guilty at all, and she told Adele so.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t believe it is he,” Adele answered
with a gleam of mischief in her eye. “I have always
believed it is Polly. I saw Eb sitting on
her head whispering things in her ear one day,
when I was coming to your house, so maybe he
puts her up to it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>“You are so silly, Adele,” returned Jessie impatiently,
and turning away.</p>

<p>Adele ran after. “Don’t get mad, Jessie.
Please don’t. I was only fooling, but it is such
fun to pretend things about Polly. If you won’t
get mad, I will tell you a secret; a very great
secret. Say you aren’t mad.”</p>

<p>“I’m not so very mad,” Jessie answered, the
prospect of a secret being more than she could
withstand.</p>

<p>The children were in the attic snuggled near
the heater, for it had suddenly grown quite cold.
“Guess who the secret is about,” said Adele.</p>

<p>“About us?”</p>

<p>“You and me, do you mean? Well, partly.”</p>

<p>“Is Dapple Gray coming home?”</p>

<p>Adele looked grave. “No, not yet, though
papa said the other day that he was very sure I
could have him some time, if I kept on improving.
I’ll tell you who the secret is about and then you
can guess some more. It is about Miss Eloise.”</p>

<p>“Is she going away?” asked Jessie in alarm,
for she had become very fond of her teacher.</p>

<p>Adele shook her head. “No, at least she is
and she isn’t.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>“I don’t see how that could be.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you? I do. She might be going away
from our house but not from the neighborhood.”</p>

<p>“Why should she do that? Oh, do tell me,
Adele. I can’t possibly guess.”</p>

<p>“Well,” agreed Adele, “it is this way. Miss
Eloise is engaged to be married to a professor or
teacher or something. He has been here to see
her, and, what do you think? If they can find
a house big enough near here they are going to
take it and have a school next year, and I shall
go to it. Papa is so pleased, because he says he
will never have to send me away to school then.”</p>

<p>“Shall you like going to a man?” asked Jessie
somewhat disturbed.</p>

<p>“Oh, the teachers won’t all be men,” said
Adele, “and I like Mr. Davis very much. So will
you, for of course you will go, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Where will the school be?”</p>

<p>“They can’t tell till they see what house they
can get.”</p>

<p>Jessie was thoughtful for a moment, then
presently she cried, “I know. I know just the
place. It isn’t very far from here. We can see
it from the window, now that the trees are bare.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
It is a great big white house with ever so many
rooms in it. Father knows all about it. It is
this side the railroad track, so I could go there.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come, let’s go tell Miss Eloise,” said
Adele with an eagerness which seemed to suggest
that perhaps the house would disappear
over night. And the two sought Miss Eloise
without delay.</p>

<p>“I’ve told Jessie your secret,” said Adele
bursting in upon her teacher, “and she knows
exactly the house for you and Mr. Davis. Her
father can tell you all about it.”</p>

<p>Miss Eloise looked up from her embroidery, a
little flush mounting to her cheek. “What do
you think of my secret, Jessie?” she asked drawing
the little girl to her side.</p>

<p>“I think it is a very nice one for Mr. Davis,”
she answered.</p>

<p>Miss Eloise laughed, and Miss Betty said, “I
must tell him that.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you think it is nice for me?”
Miss Eloise asked Jessie.</p>

<p>“Maybe I shall think it is nice if you live in
‘The Beeches,’” she said.</p>

<p>“Then we surely must see about it. Is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
name of the place ‘The Beeches,’ and is it near
here?”</p>

<p>“It is just beyond our place,” Jessie told her,
“but the house hasn’t been lived in for a long
time. The man who owns it has gone abroad
and wants to sell it. My father can tell you all
about it, for we have the keys at our house.”</p>

<p>“Then we must certainly see about it,” said
Miss Eloise, turning to Miss Betty. “That would
just suit, Betty, and I should rather be on this
side the railroad, for then we should be between
Appledore and Fulton so we could control both.
Thank you, Jessie, for coming to tell me. Of
course we shall not open our school till next fall,
but if the house is out of repair it will take some
time to put it in order, and one should be in plenty
of time for such things. Must you go now?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is getting late,” said Jessie, “and I
mustn’t be out after dark.”</p>

<p>“I hope you are bundled up warm,” said Miss
Betty, “for it is getting so cold.”</p>

<p>“I’ll run all the way,” said Jessie, “and that
will keep me warm.” She made her adieux and
started off, her thoughts full of Miss Eloise and
her secret.</p>

<p class="ph3"><i>CHAPTER XII</i><br>

<i>What Was Found Out</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> winter had really come was made apparent
the next morning when a light fall of
snow covered the ground. Jessie looked out of
her window and saw that Playmate Polly wore
a white hood and that a scarf of snow hung down
on one side of her. “I think it looks rather
well,” said Jessie to herself. “I wonder if
mother will let me go where I can see closer. I
have never been to Polly’s in winter time. I
wish it were Saturday.”</p>

<p>She was so excited over the new snow that she
could scarcely wait till breakfast was over to go
down the hill toward the brook. Mrs. Loomis
consented to her making a short call upon Playmate
Polly. “For I do so want to see her white
hood,” said Jessie, “and I will wear my rubbers
so I shall not get my feet wet. If Adele comes
tell her I will be back in five minutes, or may I
stay ten minutes, mother?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>“Not longer,” her mother told her.</p>

<p>She set off over the untrodden snow that lay
between the house and the fence, but beyond
this she discovered that some one had been before
her, for there were footprints in the snow,
queer little footprints that went on for a short
distance and then stopped beginning again further
on.</p>

<p>“Eb has been down to see Polly,” said Jessie
to herself. She ran on leaving her own footprints
by the side of Eb’s and when she was
within a little distance of the row of willows, she
saw that Eb was sitting on Polly’s head, and
was, as Adele said, whispering in her ear. Jessie
stood still for a moment to watch him, and
while she was looking suddenly he disappeared.
Jessie was astonished. “Where in the world
has he gone?” she exclaimed. “I saw him and
then I didn’t see him. I must go right there and
ask Polly about it.” She went on toward the
tree and presently discovered that which had the
appearance of a hood when she saw it from her
window had now changed into a wreath upon
Polly’s head. “I think that is very funny,” said
Jessie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>She went close to the tree and looked up, and
while she was looking, out popped Eb’s black
head from the centre of the wreath of snow. At
sight of Jessie he began to scold and repeat his
“Hallo” a great many times. “I do believe
there is a hole there,” said Jessie. “I never
knew that before, but then I am not tall enough
to see over the top of your head, Polly. That is
why you have a wreath instead of a hood. I
wish I could see in.” She looked at Eb who was
strutting uneasily about, and an idea came to
her. “I do believe, Ebony Loomis,” she exclaimed,
“that is where you hide things!”</p>

<p>Full of this discovery, she ran up to the barn
where she saw Sam. “I wish you would bring
a ladder, Sam,” she said. “I want to see if there
is a hole in that little tree. I believe it is where
Eb hides his treasures.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say so,” said Sam. “What makes
you think that?”</p>

<p>“I saw his tracks on the way down. First he
would walk a little and then he would fly, for
there were spaces between the tracks. When I
got down there I saw him sitting on the tree, and
I believe he had something in his beak, though I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
couldn’t see exactly. All of a sudden he wasn’t
there, but in a minute I saw his head pop up from
the top of the tree.” Not for the world would
she have divulged to Sam that Playmate Polly
was really a person. He would never understand
how such a thing could be.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder if you was right,” said
Sam. “I can’t go down just this minute, but
after a while I will go and look.”</p>

<p>“I wish you could go now,” said Jessie, “for
I have got to go to school.”</p>

<p>“Wish I could,” Sam answered, “but I will go
before you get back. I reckon if there is anything
there it will stay. He ain’t likely to move
it.” Jessie was obliged to be satisfied with this,
and knowing it was high time she was off to her
lessons, she went up to the house for her books,
stopping to tell her mother of what she suspected
Eb. But there was not much time to discuss it
then, for it was getting late and she must hurry
away.</p>

<p>She found Adele in a high state of excitement
over the arrival of the big dog her father had
promised her. He was a beautiful collie, and
already had attached himself to his little mistress.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
It is safe to say that lessons did not receive the
attention they should that morning. Moreover
even Eb’s tricks were lost sight of in the presence
of the new pet. So Adele was not told of what
Jessie had seen that morning.</p>

<p>Indeed it was not till after dinner that Jessie
remembered that Sam was going to investigate
the top of Playmate Polly’s snow-wreathed head;
and she hunted him up to find out what he had
discovered. He was not at the barn where she
first looked for him, but as she turned from there
she heard a chop-chopping from the direction of
the brook. What was Sam doing? She hurried
toward the spot, and saw him with axe uplifted.
She uttered one cry of dismay and the next minute
Polly toppled over and lay prostrate on the
ground. She ran toward the fallen figure of her
late companion. “Oh, poor Polly,” she whispered
under her breath, her eyes full of tears.</p>

<p>When she reached the place where Playmate
Polly had stood Sam was bending over a hollow
stump. He looked up with a laugh. “You was
right,” he said. “Here’s that little black thief’s
treasure.” He put his hand into the stump and
drew forth the three spoons, a brass thimble, some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
shining bits of glass, several bright buttons, and,
last of all, Adele’s lost Peter Pan. “Well, I
never!” exclaimed Sam.</p>

<p>Jessie drew a long sigh. “Oh, Sam,” she said
tremulously, “why did you have to cut it down?”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t no good,” said Sam. “Hollow all
through. Your father said it had best come
down, and then we could see what that rascal
had hid there.”</p>

<p>“But I liked her,” said Jessie sadly, feeling
that she had been the cause of Playmate Polly’s
downfall.</p>

<p>Sam looked at her curiously. “First time I
ever heard a tree called <i>her</i>,” he said.</p>

<p>Jessie looked at the chips scattered around, at
Polly’s head from which her wreath had fallen.
“Oh, dear! oh, dear!” she sighed.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Sam. “Ain’t
you glad to get your doll baby back?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t mine; it’s Adele’s,” said Jessie.
“Yes, I am very glad to get that. Oh, Sam!”
she cried in alarm as she saw him with axe again
uplifted, “you’re not going to chop her to pieces!”</p>

<p>Sam lowered the axe. “I thought I might as
well,” he said. “Make a little fire-wood.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>“Please don’t! Please don’t!” she cried.</p>

<p>“Well, you’re a funny one all right,” said Sam
shouldering his axe. “Settle it with your father;
’tain’t no odds to me.”</p>

<p>Jessie stood for a moment looking at the prostrate
Polly and then she turned and walked
slowly to the house, carrying with her the three
spoons and the little scarlet-coated Peter Pan.
She went into the sitting-room and laid the
things on the table. “Mother,” she said solemnly,
“Playmate Polly is dead.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Loomis looked up from her sewing.
“What on earth do you mean, daughter?” she
said.</p>

<p>Jessie picked up the things she had laid on the
table. “Sam has felled her to the earth,” she
said, “and he found these.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Loomis tried to hide a smile at Jessie’s
tragic manner. “What did he find?” she asked.</p>

<p>Jessie handed her the spoons and the doll.</p>

<p>“Then the crow did hide them, and it was you
who found him out.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did it,” returned Jessie. “Poor Polly!
I did it.”</p>

<p>“My dear little girl,” said Mrs. Loomis, “you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
mustn’t feel badly about an old hollow tree. I
suppose Sam had to cut it down in order to get
at the things.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose so,” returned Jessie, “but I
did like her so much. Will she have to be
chopped up for fire-wood, mother? Sam was going
to do it, but I stopped him, and he said I must
settle it with father. Do you suppose he will
care if she isn’t?”</p>

<p>“I don’t imagine he will care at all, for a little
old tree like that would be small loss.”</p>

<p>“Will you ask him not to?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, if you like; but why not ask him
yourself?”</p>

<p>“I don’t like to talk to any one but you about
Polly,” said Jessie after a pause. “Even Adele
never could understand.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Loomis kissed the rather woe-be-gone little
face. “Then, my darling,” she said, “I am
very sorry you have lost your Polly, and you
may rest assured that she shall stay just as she
lies as long as you wish. I am very glad to get
back the spoons, though I am sorry they could
not have been discovered in another place.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to get back Adele’s doll, too. Here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
she comes now, mother, and she has her lovely
dog with her.”</p>

<p>Adele came in with a rush, her dog, which she
had named Rob, frisking after her. “Go out,
Rob,” cried Adele. “Aunt Betty said I could
bring him if I promised he shouldn’t come in the
house. His feet are all wet.” She closed the
door after Rob, shutting him out on the porch,
where he lay down to wait for her. “Why,
where did you find my Peter Pan?” asked
Adele whose quick eyes spied the doll first thing.</p>

<p>“Sam found it and the spoons in a hollow tree.
It was Eb who took it and the spoons, too. He
hid them with some other things.”</p>

<p>“I knew it was Polly,” said Adele with a
laugh. “I always said she had them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Adele, don’t talk that way,” returned
Jessie in a distressed voice. “Polly is dead.”</p>

<p>Adele looked at her for a minute to see if she
really were in earnest. “What do you mean?”
she said.</p>

<p>“Sam had to chop her down to get at the things.
They were down so deep he couldn’t reach them.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Adele, “I am sorry, Jessie, I truly
am, and I wish I had never said mean things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
about her. I shall never, never, never, be so horrid
again.”</p>

<p>Playmate Polly was allowed to lie where she
had fallen, and in time the green grass and flowering
weeds grew up all around her and quite hid
her from view. And the next year there was no
thievish crow to hide away his spoils in hollow
trees. For with the spring came visitors of his
own kind, among them such a charming young
lady crow as caused Eb to forsake his old friends,
and he flew away with the flock to live a wild
life. Once Jessie passing along through the orchard
heard something above her head cry out:
“Hallo!” and she believed the black wings which
she saw among the branches must belong to her
old pet, and the next winter a pair of crows came
often, when the snow was on the ground, to feed
with the chickens. Minerva never drove them
away, for she believed it was Eb and his mate
who had returned to his familiar haunts, counting
upon receiving hospitality.</p>

<p>Thus Jessie lost two of her companions, but as
time went on she and Adele became closer friends,
who were happy with Rob, Cloudy and the dolls.
Before it was time to open the grotto again,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
Adele had renamed her doll of the scarlet coat.
“I shall call him Reddy,” she said to Jessie, who
understood that on account of Playmate Polly
and the old quarrel, Adele wanted to be generous.</p>

<p>So Peter Pan had it all his own way, though
he often went to see Reddy in a fine cave that
Jessie helped Adele make for him.</p>

<p>Early in June Miss Eloise left the yellow house
to be married, and one day, a couple of weeks
after, there was a great stir and bustle at “The
Beeches.” Mrs. Loomis, Miss Betty, Dr. and Mrs.
Sadtler were all on hand to welcome home the
bride and groom. Jessie and Adele were on the
watch for the carriage as it drove from the station.
Adele was the first to spy it coming up the
road. “There they are!” she cried.</p>

<p>“There they are,” echoed Jessie. “Let’s run
and get the dears.”</p>

<p>The two stood on the porch as Mr. and Mrs.
Davis alighted. Adele was the first to rush forward
and thrust something into Mr. Davis’s arms.
“This is for you,” she cried.</p>

<p>“And this is for you.” Jessie turned to Mrs.
Davis and deposited in her arms a small black
kitten.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>Mr. Davis accepted the roly-poly puppy that
Adele had given him and turning to his wife, he
said, “You know all along, Eloise, I have declared
we must have a dog.”</p>

<p>“And I said no home could be complete without
a cat,” returned his wife laughing. “You are
two dear children to supply our wants so soon,”
she said to the little girls.</p>

<p>“We think it is going to be lovely here,” said
Adele eagerly.</p>

<p>“Max and Walter are coming here to school,”
Jessie announced. “Are you glad to be our
neighbors, Miss Eloise?”</p>

<p>“My dear, I am delighted. I didn’t realize
what a charming old place this really was.
What have you all been doing to it?” She
looked around upon a well ordered garden, upon
a smoothly cut lawn, upon a freshly painted porch
where boxes of flowers stood, and then she caught
sight of the group within doors who were standing
to welcome her. “You dear people,” she said
holding out her hands. “How good you are to
us, and how the whole place is changed. What
fairy work is this?”</p>

<p>“You must ask these little girls,” said Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
Loomis, smiling down at Jessie and Adele.
“They put it into our heads, and said it was a
shame for you to come home to a dingy old
house, to a neglected lawn and a flowerless
garden, and so we thought, too. Therefore we
have all taken turns in seeing that things were
done as they should be. And now come in to
supper.”</p>

<p>“Supper?” Mrs. Davis looked at her husband.
“And we looked forward to an empty house with
a still emptier larder. We said we should have
to picnic for days till we could get the house in
running order.” Still holding the kitten, she put
her free arm around both little girls, and they
wondered why her eyes should be full of tears.
“We shall never feel like strangers here, Fred,”
she said to Mr. Davis.</p>

<p>“Indeed, I should say not,” he replied. “This
is a true home-coming.”</p>

<p>All summer long work went on in the big
white house till fall found it ready with classrooms,
with a new gymnasium, with pretty sleeping
rooms for the boarding pupils. And every
room was filled, while the day scholars were not
a few.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>Jessie and Adele started off together. Max
and Walter had already gone on ahead. Adele
was unusually thoughtful on the way. “What
are you thinking of?” Jessie asked her. “You
are so quiet.”</p>

<p>“I was thinking about a lot of things,” was
the reply. “I was thinking suppose papa had
not found the yellow house for us to live in,
then I should never have known you, Miss Eloise
would never have found ‘The Beeches,’ and I
might have been far away somewhere, just as
lonely as I was before.”</p>

<p>“But you did come to the yellow house, you
see,” said Jessie, “and now we are friends and
are always going to the same school.”</p>

<p>“And after we grow up we shall still be
friends. Say we shall, Jessie.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” returned Jessie.</p>

<p>Max ahead of them called over his shoulder,
“You two had better hurry up. We don’t want
to be late the first day.”</p>

<p>The two girls increased their lagging pace.
“We’re coming,” Jessie called.</p>

<p class="ph5"><i>Molly Brown’s Freshman Days</i></p>

<p>Would you like to admit to your circle
of friends the most charming of college
girls? Then seek an introduction
to Molly Brown. You will find the baggagemaster,
the cook, the Professor of
English Literature and the College President
in the same company.</p>

<p class="ph5"><i>Molly Brown’s Sophomore
Days</i></p>

<p>What is more delightful than a reunion
of college girls after the summer
vacation? Certainly nothing that precedes
it in their experience—at least, if all class-mates are as
happy together as the Wellington girls of this story. Among
Molly’s interesting friends of the second year is a young
Japanese girl, who ingratiates her “humbly” self into everybody’s
affections.</p>

<p class="ph5"><i>Molly Brown’s Junior Days</i></p>

<p>Financial stumbling-blocks are not the only thing that hinder
the ease and increase the strength of college girls. Their
troubles and their triumphs are their own, often peculiar to their
environment. How Wellington students meet the experiences
outside the classrooms is worth the doing, the telling and the
reading.</p>

<p class="ph5"><i>Molly Brown’s Senior Days</i></p>

<p>This book tells of another year of glad college life, bringing the
girls to the days of diplomas and farewells, and introducing
new friends to complicate old friendships.</p>

<p class="ph5"><i>Molly Brown’s Post Graduate Days</i></p>

<p>“Book I” of this volume is devoted to incidents that happen
in Molly’s Kentucky home, and “Book II” is filled with the
interests pertaining to Wellington College and the reunions of a
post graduate year.</p>

<p class="ph5"><i>Molly Brown’s Orchard Home</i></p>

<p>Molly’s romance culminates in Paris—the Paris of art, of
music, of light-hearted gaiety—after a glad, sad, mad year for
Molly and her friends.</p>

<p>If you do not know Molly Brown of Kentucky, you are missing
an opportunity to become acquainted with the most enchanting
girl in college fiction.</p>

<p class="ph5">THE MOTOR MAIDS’ SCHOOL
DAYS</p>

<p>Billie Campbell was just the type of
straightforward, athletic girl to be successful
as a practical Motor Maid. She
took her car, as she did her class-mates,
to her heart, and many a grand good time
did they have all together. The road over
which she ran her red machine had many
an unexpected turning.</p>

<p class="ph5">THE MOTOR MAIDS BY PALM
AND PINE</p>

<p>Wherever the Motor Maids went there
were lively times, for these were companionable
girls who looked upon the
world as a vastly interesting place full
of unique adventures.</p>

<p class="ph5">THE MOTOR MAIDS ACROSS THE CONTINENT</p>

<p>It is always interesting to travel, and it is wonderfully entertaining
to see old scenes through fresh eyes. It is that
privilege, therefore, that makes it worth while to join the
Motor Maids in their first ’cross-country run.</p>

<p class="ph5">THE MOTOR MAIDS BY ROSE, SHAMROCK AND
THISTLE</p>

<p>South and West had the Motor Maids motored, nor could their
education by travel have been more wisely begun. But now a
speaking acquaintance with their own country enriched their
anticipation of an introduction to the British Isles. How they
made their polite American how and how they were received
on the other side is a tale of interest and inspiration.</p>

<p class="ph5">THE MOTOR MAIDS IN FAIR JAPAN</p>

<p>In a picturesque villa among picturesque surroundings the
Motor Maids spend a happy vacation. The charm of Japan,—her
cherry blossoms, her temples, her quaint customs, her polite
people,—is reflected in all their delightful experiences.</p>

<p class="ph5">THE MOTOR MAIDS AT SUNRISE CAMP</p>

<p>Most interesting of all interesting events recorded about the
Motor Maids are these relating to their summer in a mountain
camp. The new friends introduced in this book add the final
touch of romance.</p>

<p>Charmingly written books which will delight all girls who
are fond of outdoor life—and most girls are. The trips taken by
these Motor Maids would envy any girl, yet you can have
all pleasant experiences by reading the stories.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/girlaviators.jpg" alt="book cover"></div>

<p class="ph5"><i>The Girl Aviators and the
Phantom Airship</i></p>

<p>Roy Prescott was fortunate in having a
sister so clever and devoted to him and
his interests that they would share work
and play with mutual pleasure and to
mutual advantage. This proved especially
true in relation to the manufacture
and manipulation of their aeroplane, and
Peggy won well deserved fame for her
skill and good sense as an aviator. There
were many stumbling-blocks in their terrestrial
path, but they soared above them
all to ultimate success.</p>

<p class="ph5"><i>The Girl Aviators on Golden Wings</i></p>

<p>That there is a peculiar fascination about aviation that wins
and holds girls enthusiasts as well as boys is proved by this
tale. On golden wings the girl aviators rose for many an exciting
flight, and met strange and unexpected experiences.</p>

<p class="ph5"><i>The Girl Aviators’ Sky Cruise</i></p>

<p>To most girls a coaching or yachting trip is an adventure.
How much more perilous an adventure a “sky cruise” might be
is suggested by the title and proved by the story itself.</p>

<p class="ph5"><i>The Girl Aviators’ Motor Butterfly</i></p>

<p>The delicacy of flight suggested by the word “butterfly,” the
mechanical power implied by “motor,” the ability to control
assured in the title “aviator,” all combined with the personality
and enthusiasm of girls themselves, make this story one for
any girl or other reader “to go crazy over.”</p>

<p>Aviation is not confined to the sterner sex as has been shown
by the flights made by Harriet Quimby and other daring young
women. Girls who are fond of adventure will thoroughly
enjoy reading these books, which are wholesome and free
from sensationalism.</p>
